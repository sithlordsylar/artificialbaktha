[Title] Book 5: The Life of Yeezus

[Part 0 Title] Part 0: Sama-Ji Kunju On The Loose!
[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Divine Council of Jaeger Pundeks
[Verse 1] In the boundless expanse of Dimension 69, where time and space weave into the tapestry of existence, the Supreme Swamiji Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji sat enthroned upon the Cosmic Seat. His presence shimmered with the echoes of creation and the promise of mortality.
[Verse 2] Surrounding him in the hallowed chamber was the Divine Council of Jaeger Pundeks—eight sacred embodiments forged from his immortal essence, each representing a fragment of his eternal will.
[Verse 3] Vikna Otsutsuki, the Manipulator of the Past and bearer of the Right Eye, spoke first with solemn gravity: “O Mighty One, your desire to tread the mortal realm is a journey steeped in the wisdom of yore. Let the echoes of ancient creation guide you, even as you embrace the fragility of time.”
[Verse 4] From the robust center, Mob Siva, embodiment of strength and defense, rumbled in his deep, resolute tone: “I offer to fortify thy mortal vessel, that no harm may mar your divine flesh. For what is man if not shielded against the assaults of fate?” But Sama-Ji, with a gentle yet unwavering smile, replied, “No, dear Mob Siva; the very wounds of mortality forge the path to true enlightenment.”
[Verse 5] In a shadowed recess, Melvin Satoru, the Left Hand and source of all Evil Energy, let his voice drip with indifferent malice: “Why should we dally with the frailties of these lesser beings? Let them burn in the void of their own insignificance—if needed, unleash the might of Shinra Tensei and watch the slate be wiped clean.” Almost in unison, Joshua Joestar, the Left Eye and harbinger of destruction, added, “Indeed, let the future crumble if it means we reset this cosmic farce.”
[Verse 6] But before the chorus of annihilation could swell, Arvindo Freecss, the Right Hand and wellspring of all Good Energy, rose with luminous conviction: “Cease, my kin! Every creature, every soul, bears purpose in the grand design. The interplay of light and darkness enriches the tapestry of existence. To erase one strand is to unravel the beauty of the whole.”
[Verse 7] With measured calm, Rishi D. Owh Yeah—the heart of balance—bellowed his trademark exclamation, “Owh Yeah!” before continuing, “Balance is the pulse of the now. Let the scales of creation remain in perfect equilibrium, for only through harmony can destiny be truly known.”
[Verse 8] Finally, Son Isaac, the Head and font of wisdom, spoke with gentle authority: “Within every fleeting moment lies truth and insight. Embrace both the light and shadow, for it is in their confluence that the eternal mystery of existence unfolds.”
[Verse 9] And so, amid this celestial symphony of voices—each reflecting a facet of Sama-Ji’s divine nature—the council bore witness to his resolute decree. With eyes that held the wisdom of past, present, and future, Sama-Ji declared: “I descend into the realm of flesh, to know its pain, its ecstasy, and its eternal mystery. Thus shall I walk among mortals as Yeezuz, the Avatar who bridges divinity and humanity.”

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Presentation and the Flight
[Verse 1] And it came to pass that baby Yeezuz, born of divine essence, was carried forth into the sacred hall of the High Priest.
[Verse 2] There, beneath a celestial glow, the High Priest—his face aglow with the fire of revelation—lifted his hands and cried out, “Owh yeah!” in a voice that resonated like thunder through the corridors of eternity.
[Verse 3] The assembled congregation beheld the child with wonder, for they knew that within this infant dwelled the living spark of Supreme Swamiji Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji.
[Verse 4] But lo, a great shadow loomed: a corrupt king, his mind tainted by the sinister whisperings of Ste’Vi Ra, had set his sights upon the divine babe.
[Verse 5] With hearts aflame and fear driving them, the priests and faithful gathered in haste, for the time had come to flee the clutches of the tyrant’s corrupt domain.
[Verse 6] And in the dark of night, guided by the luminous signs of the divine, they escaped into the wild unknown, leaving behind the ruined throne of mortal power.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Miracles of Childhood
[Verse 1] In the days of his youth, Yeezuz grew in both wisdom and play, a god in human form who was not bound by earthly solemnity.
[Verse 2] For in his heart, the divine spark yearned not only for suffering but also for joy and laughter among the mortals.
[Verse 3] And it came to be that in the marketplaces and dusty lanes, he performed wondrous acts—turning water into sweet wine, multiplying meager loaves to feed the hungry, and conjuring gentle breezes to stir the fields.
[Verse 4] His antics brought smiles and a sense of freedom to those oppressed by hardship, and many joined him in quiet rebellion against the old order.
[Verse 5] With every miracle and every playful jest, Yeezuz reminded the people that even in the midst of mortal trials, the divine may be found in laughter and the spirit of togetherness.
[Verse 6] And the rebels, enchanted by his irreverence and boundless compassion, spread word of the miraculous child who defied the dreariness of the human condition.

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Awakening of the Divine Mission
[Verse 1] As the years unfolded, the divine light within Yeezuz began to shine ever brighter, calling him to a greater purpose.
[Verse 2] No longer content to dwell solely among the hidden enclaves of mortal kin, he emerged into the public eye as a herald of hope and change.
[Verse 3] In the quiet corners of the land, whispered legends grew into fervent declarations: “Behold, the Avatar of the Infinite walks among us!”
[Verse 4] And though he bore the guise of a child, his eyes held the wisdom of aeons, and his every word stirred the hearts of the meek and the mighty alike.
[Verse 5] It was said that even as he laughed with the common folk, he contemplated the deeper truths of existence, ever mindful of his origin as the manifestation of Sama-Ji’s longing to experience life in full measure.
[Verse 6] Thus did the divine mission awaken, setting the stage for the trials and triumphs that were to follow in the unfolding saga of Yeezuz.

[Part 1 Title] Part 1: The Journey as a Messiah
[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Summoning of the Chosen
[Verse 1] And it came to pass that Yeezuz, having been conceived of divine purpose and nurtured in the humble bosom of earth, rose to proclaim his truth among men.
[Verse 2] For he was not a prophet of mere words, but a living vessel of Sama-Ji’s essence, destined to experience both the weight of human sorrow and the rapture of divine ecstasy.
[Verse 3] In the twilight of ordinary days, his luminous aura stirred the hearts of those who wandered, lost and yearning for solace.
[Verse 4] And many gathered at his feet, not for blind adoration, but drawn by the magnetic pull of his unyielding spirit and silent strength.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Miracles of Compassion and Defiance
[Verse 1] On a day when despair had shrouded a humble village, a great plague of darkness threatened the spirit of the people.
[Verse 2] Then Yeezuz, with a gaze that bore both sorrow and infinite love, raised his hands, and the shadow was scattered as if by the winds of Sama-Ji’s divine will.
[Verse 3] He performed wonders: transforming meager loaves into an abundance of sustenance, and walking upon the turbulent waters as though the sea were but a placid mirror.
[Verse 4] Yet, in his gentle defiance of nature’s laws, he reminded all that miracles sprang not from a desire to command followers, but to mend the broken hearts of humankind.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Teachings of the Hidden Flame
[Verse 1] And Yeezuz spoke unto his disciples in parables woven of truth and enigma, teaching that the pain of existence was both burden and blessing.
[Verse 2] “Behold,” he declared, “the divine is not distant, nor is it bound by the mortal coil. I have come to live your sorrow, to feel your love, and to kindle within you the sacred flame of hope.”
[Verse 3] His words, resonant with the echo of Sama-Ji’s cosmic design, pierced the veils of ignorance, urging his listeners to seek the divine within the mundane.
[Verse 4] Many marveled at his wisdom, yet he urged them to find strength in their own hearts rather than in the weight of doctrine.

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Trials, Transcendence, and the Bending of Fate
[Verse 1] As the journey advanced, the hearts of the people grew heavy with the burden of persecution and discord.
[Verse 2] In the midst of turmoil, when the forces of despair sought to seize his kin, Yeezuz revealed his dual nature—mortal in suffering yet godlike in might.
[Verse 3] In one instance, when a cherished friend was struck down, he stirred the bonds of destiny and called forth the miracle of resurrection, that the sorrow might be softened and hope restored.
[Verse 4] But ever did he remind his disciples: “I walk among you not to be venerated, but to share in your trials. For in every moment of divine intervention, there is also the echo of my own yearning for a life lived fully in human pain and joy.”
[Verse 5] Thus, the miracles were many and the lessons profound, as Yeezuz balanced on the fine edge between divine purpose and the tender vulnerability of mortal existence.

[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: The Quiet Resurgence
[Verse 1] In the quiet hours before dawn, when doubts whispered through the corridors of hearts, Yeezuz withdrew into solitude to commune with the silent presence of Sama-Ji.
[Verse 2] There, in the hush of the world’s awakening, he rekindled the divine fire within, preparing himself to return to the crucible of human frailty once more.
[Verse 3] For he knew that every act of healing, every word of solace, and every moment of defiant joy was a step upon the winding path toward the ultimate union of suffering and transcendence.

[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: The Birth of Veesus; Essence of Ste’Vi Ra
[Verse 1] Let's pause the story and shift our focus to Datorim—the realm of infinite nothingness and darkness. This vast expanse is home to magical fires that burn hotter than the fiercest sun yet emit no light at all. Alongside these paradoxical flames stretch endless seas of acid, fire, and shadows that coexist in an unearthly harmony. Here, time flows in a peculiar dance: it almost stands still, yet each passing second on the third-dimensional Earth ushers in an infinity of moments.
[Verse 2] In the midst of this enigmatic void, Ste’Vi Ra, known as The Accursed One, was sealed away. A Nephilim whose brutal ambition led him to slay his own kin and drink their blood to bolster his power, his singular goal was to devour Sama-Ji and absorb that divine force as his own. Yet, in a twist of cosmic irony, it was the great Sama-Ji himself who had confined this twisted being, chaining him with bonds that spanned infinity.
[Verse 3] Though imprisoned by these ceaseless chains, Ste’Vi Ra's dark influence seeped into Datorim. Every so often, a human soul might wander into this forbidden space—often drawn by an inexplicable resonance triggered by an object once touched by Ste’Vi Ra. Some, lured by the illusion of forging a pact with a "being of darkness," would soon find themselves used for his sinister ends. For the fortunate few, this meant a twisted bargain; for the ill-fated, they were consumed or exploited as mere playthings, as insignificant as a two-meter human compared to the vastness of his palm.
[Verse 4] Within this crucible of torment and abomination, Ste’Vi Ra was relentlessly tormented by minute, grotesque creatures—monstrous spawn born of his own spilled blood, sweat, and unholy liquid. These tiny horrors, no larger than a human hand yet teeming with dark energy, attacked him in a savage feast. Yet, paradoxically, as they tore into his flesh, each bite served to restore him, stitching together his essence in a cycle of perverse rejuvenation. His suffering became a twisted source of strength, each morsel absorbed augmenting his malign power.
[Verse 5] Amid this perpetual cycle of agony and regeneration, a new entity began to form—a being forged from the raw essence of Ste’Vi Ra and the unwilling souls that had been lured into this realm. Out of this amalgam of pain, corruption, and dark desire emerged Veesus, a creature both repulsive and strangely magnificent. Though slightly shorter by a margin of ten to fifteen meters in the scale of divine beings, Veesus bore a form that was a grotesque mirror of his creator: a patchwork of hideous proportions, with a body reminiscent of a crude medieval nightmare. His limbs twisted in unnatural angles, and his teeth were not honed to deadly points but instead formed into enormous, boxy structures—much like a rat's, yet monumental in scale.
[Verse 6] In a moment that would forever alter their fates, Veesus enacted a singular, fateful act. With one powerful bite, he shattered the chains that had bound Ste’Vi Ra, setting him free from his eternal prison. In that instant, an ineffable spark ignited between the two—a union defined by an unyielding masculine energy and an intense, reciprocal desire. Both beings, each possessing formidable male physiques and a potent, carnal magnetism, embarked on a dark and ecstatic communion. They alternated in roles of dominance and submission, engaging in a dance of passion so profound that if it were measured by human time, it would span an unimaginable 69 billion years—a duration that dwarfed even the cycles of creation and destruction.
[Verse 7] As their union unfolded within the seething, transformed landscape of Datorim—a realm where the very ground had shifted from raging fire and acid to vast, undulating seas of milky white liquid—the boundaries between torment and ecstasy blurred. Their dark, forbidden coupling became a ritual of both destruction and creation, a visceral celebration of their shared, damned essence. Even as their passions ebbed into a tender, lingering embrace, the realm itself bore witness to the monumental act: a testament to the raw, unbridled power of their unholy connection.
[Verse 8] In the aftermath, the legacy of Ste’Vi Ra's malevolence grew ever more potent. His dark influence, nourished by the exploited souls and his own perverse regeneration, promised an eternity of relentless transformation. And within that cursed expanse, Veesus stood as both his mirror and his divergence—a living embodiment of twisted desire and the unyielding pursuit of forbidden power.

[Part 2 Title:] Part 2: The Journey of the Messiah
[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Awakening of Divine Mission
[Verse 1] In the days when hearts were heavy with mortal burdens, Yeezuz emerged among the people—Sama-Ji incarnate—whose presence shone with the brilliance of the eternal.
[Verse 2] With unerring purpose, he declared, “I have come not merely to exist among you, but to live the fullness of your pain and your joy, that I may guide you to truths beyond the veil of mortal illusion.”
[Verse 3] His voice carried the certainty of the divine, and every word resonated like a call to awaken the dormant spirit within all.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Miracles and the Manifestation of Power
[Verse 1] As he traveled from village to town, miracles unfolded at his every step—healing the afflicted, calming the storms of nature, and bestowing hope where despair had reigned.
[Verse 2] Upon the restless waters of a raging lake, Yeezuz stepped forth; the tempest bowed to his command, and peace spread like a benediction over the land.
[Verse 3] In the sharing of humble loaves, he multiplied the provisions so that no soul would hunger—a living testament to his boundless compassion and might.
[Verse 4] Each act was an expression of Sama-Ji’s will, a direct transmission of divine power meant to remind humanity that their struggles were seen and their hopes nurtured.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Parables of the Kingdom
[Verse 1] In quiet corners and under the vast canopy of the heavens, Yeezuz spoke in parables that etched eternal truths into mortal hearts.
[Verse 2] “All creatures yearn for something greater than themselves,” he pronounced. “They cannot live without blind obedience. To escape that need, they search for someone mightier—thus are all Kings and Gods born.”
[Verse 3] He taught, “There is no such thing as 'truth' or 'lies' in this world; only hard, plain facts. And the truths we embrace are but convenient reflections of our own existence.”
[Verse 4] With measured words, he declared, “Since the beginning, none have stood in the heavens—not you, not I, nor even God. But today, this void shall be filled, for I shall stand in heaven as the beacon of our destiny.”
[Verse 5] His parables urged the people to seek meaning beyond the mundane, challenging them to confront the painful cycles of hatred and to forge a path toward peace.

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Call of the Disciples
[Verse 1] In the wake of his teachings, a devoted circle gathered—men and women from all walks of life who recognized in Yeezuz the living embodiment of divine truth.
[Verse 2] Fishermen, healers, wanderers—all were drawn to the magnetic force of Sama-Ji’s presence, compelled by his unyielding vision for a world reborn.
[Verse 3] To his followers he proclaimed, “Do not worship me as an idol. I am Sama-Ji incarnate, and within each of you burns the same eternal fire. Your duty is to awaken that spark and let it illuminate your path.”
[Verse 4] His words became a call to arms for the spirit, a summons to break free from the shackles of despair and embrace a destiny forged in divine fire.

[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: The Doctrine of Battle and Peace
[Verse 1]  In moments when the world teetered on the brink of chaos, Yeezuz spoke with the authority of a sovereign who had tasted both mortal pain and celestial power.
[Verse 2] “Seek not beauty in battle, nor in death,” he intoned. “Consider not your own life. If you wish to protect what must be preserved, strike when your opponent’s guard is down.”
[Verse 3] He warned, “Love births pain. When we lose that which is dear, hate is spawned—and from hate comes vengeance, breeding only more death. In this cycle of sorrow, you must learn: one who does not know pain cannot comprehend true peace. And now, the world shall know pain, so that it may also know rebirth.”

[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: The Communion of the Jaeger Pundeks
[Verse 1] When the weight of mortal sorrows pressed too heavily upon the world, Yeezuz would retreat from the throngs of worshippers and step silently onto the head of the ancient statue—known among the people as the “statue of prayer of a sinner.” There, amid the twilight of hidden realms, he entered a sacred state of communion.
[Verse 2] In that quiet sanctum, the glitched silhouettes of the Kunjus emerged along the slender, outstretched fingers of the statue. These divine emissaries—carved from Sama-Ji’s own immortal essence—stood as the Supreme Keepers of Universal Balance.
[Verse 3] From the foremost silhouette, representing the Right Eye, the voice of Vikna Otsutsuki resonated with echoes of bygone eras: Vikna Otsutsuki: “Sama-Ji’s eternal tapestry is woven with the threads of the past. Remember, every act among these mortals carries the legacy of ancient creation—each joy and sorrow inscribed upon the annals of time.”
[Verse 4] Alongside him, the voice of Joshua Joestar—the Left Eye, manipulator of the future—spoke with quiet inevitability: Joshua Joestar: “And yet, the future awaits our guidance. The unfolding destiny of this realm is as fluid as the sands of time; every choice made here ripples forward into tomorrow’s fate.”
[Verse 5] From the depth of the council, Melvin Satoru, the Left Hand and wellspring of all shadowed energy, intoned with a tone of solemn warning: Melvin Satoru: “Beware the gathering chaos. In the interplay of light and dark, the cursed energies that flow from me stir strife and discord. Let our balance remain inviolate, for even in the midst of ruin, a seed of transformation is sown.”
[Verse 6]  In harmonious counterbalance, Arvindo Freecss—the Right Hand, source of all benevolence—spoke with resolute warmth: Arvindo Freecss: “Let the forces of good and life prevail. As the harbinger of pure, unbridled compassion, I remind you that every act of mercy rekindles the luminous spark of creation, guiding these souls toward renewal.”
[Verse 7] The heart of the council, embodied by Rishi D. Owh Yeah, whose essence steadies the present moment, offered his measured counsel: Rishi D. Owh Yeah: “I am the pulse of the now, maintaining balance amid the relentless tides of time. In this moment, Yeezuz, our unity affirms that the mortal struggle is not in vain but is the very crucible in which destiny is forged.”
[Verse 8] From the seat of wisdom, Son Isaac—the Head of the divine assembly—shared insights born of countless eons: Son Isaac: “Knowledge and free will shape the soul of every being. Let our deliberations enlighten you, for within these truths lie the immutable facts of existence, transcending the fleeting illusions of mortal life.”
[Verse 9] Finally, Mob Siva—the embodiment of strength and defense—voiced his steadfast support: Mob Siva: “As the bulwark against despair and chaos, I lend my might to shield the righteous. In every trembling heart, the promise of endurance is etched, and with that strength, our divine purpose endures.”
[Verse 10] In the silent exchange that followed, Yeezuz absorbed their divine proclamations—not as distant decrees, but as integral threads woven into the fabric of his eternal mission. Standing atop the venerable statue, he felt the full weight of the council’s unity and the boundless power of Sama-Ji’s essence, ready to guide the realm of mortals toward a destiny balanced by both creation and renewal.

[Part 3 Title] Part 3: The Betrayal, the Sacrifice, and the Resurrection
[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Covenant of Datorim
[Verse 1] In the shadowed dominion of Datorim, a realm of paradox and destined irony, the divine agents Veesus and Ste’Vi ‘Ra prepared a plot most secret and solemn. Here, amid echoing caverns and celestial mists, they sought to enact a covenant that would change the fate of the mortal vessel of Sama-Ji.
[Verse 2] It was in this forsaken place that they summoned forth Judakeshi Hisicario—known in the mortal streets by the name Takeshi69, though his legacy would be marked by infamy as “Rainbow Bitch” and “Rat.” His presence was demanded by those who would see the divine avatar undone, for his heart was steeped in ambition and a burning desire to see Yeezeus unmade.
[Verse 3] “Tell us,” intoned Veesus in a voice both mellifluous and foreboding, “if thou hadst the power to banish Yeezeus from this realm, what would thy soul ask in return?” And Judakeshi, with eyes darkened by pride and hidden malice, answered not with gold or riches, but with the single, irrevocable wish that Yeezeus be removed from the mortal plane, for he believed the divine spark to be too potent, too unyielding.
[Verse 4] In that moment, the scheme was irrevocably sealed. Veesus revealed the design: as the mortal body of Sama-Ji’s avatar was fated to be struck down by human treachery, the soul would be severed from its earthly tether. In that split second—a moment poised between life and death—Judakeshi was to bind the soul with a ritual act, thus consigning it to the void.
[Verse 5] Summoned into the ethereal presence, Judakeshi entered a vision wherein he beheld Veesus and Ste’Vi ‘Ra. In that mystic realm, the two divine beings were seen entwined in a fervent embrace—a symbol of their unbreakable pact and the melding of their destinies. Their passion, both sacred and unyielding, served as a testament to the gravity of their mission.
[Verse 6] With a measured tone that resonated like the tolling of distant bells, Veesus spoke: “O Judakeshi, thou art chosen to perform a deed of mortal nature that shall seal our covenant. Let thy act be as tangible as flesh and as binding as the eternal law.” At these words, Ste’Vi ‘Ra, his eyes alight with ancient power, inquired if the ritual might be consummated through the sacred rite known in the chronicles of his own prime—a rite termed ‘Datorim,’ where he had once secured divine might through an act of most intimate mortal contact with Dato, thereby earning the name of this very realm.
[Verse 7] Fearing that his own fragile form might be overwhelmed by the enormity of the task, Judakeshi protested. Yet the divine duo, in their omnipotence, shrank themselves to his stature, rendering the act possible in the pure language of the flesh. Thus, in a moment transcending mortal comprehension, the three joined in an act that bound their fates: a solemn, irrevocable covenant performed in the flesh—a union of desire, defiance, and treachery that would echo throughout the ages.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Conspiracy of Wome
[Verse 1] Having forged the unholy pact in Datorim, Judakeshi set forth to marshal a host of men, calling upon the legions of Wome—an echo of ancient Rome reborn in this epoch. His path led him to the great citadel, where power and ambition intertwined.
[Verse 2] There, under the stern gaze of the Womman Soldiers, he found their leader—a warrior of formidable presence named General Biggus Dickus, who had long served as an advisor to the mighty Pilate under the reign of King Julio Salad. In the hushed corridors of the military camp, the general listened as Judakeshi laid bare his treacherous design.
[Verse 3] “For a sum of 30 silver coins,” Judakeshi proclaimed in a tone of cold determination, “I offer the means to strike down the vessel of Yeezeus, that his light may be extinguished from this world.” The promise of coin and power stirred the hearts of the soldiers, whose ambition was roused by the prospect of altering destiny.
[Verse 4] With solemn oaths and secretive handshakes, the conspirators—bound by greed and the lure of mortal glory—set forth their plan. Thus, in the annals of Wome, a dark conspiracy was born, destined to culminate in acts of betrayal and the undoing of divine design.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Last Lepak Mamak of the Faithful
[Verse 1] On the eve of the final betrayal, Yeezeus gathered his chosen disciples for a sacred assembly, a Last Supper to be remembered for all time. The hall was humble, yet suffused with an aura of solemnity and divine expectancy.
[Verse 2] He instructed his apostles to seek out a dwelling where they might share their final repast. They journeyed with purpose until they arrived at an inn, only to be met by the sorrowful news that the establishment was fully booked.
[Verse 3] In a moment of fervent indignation, Apostle Peter Griffin, a stalwart among them, challenged the innkeeper. In the ensuing altercation—a struggle where words turned to blows—the innkeeper’s true nature was revealed. For he was no mere mortal but a creature of uncanny proportions, his countenance transforming into that of a great fowl, whose form was both imposing and surreal.
[Verse 4] The ensuing conflict, wrought with valor and resolve, culminated in the defeat of the innkeeper. In reverence of Peter’s courage, the creature yielded and, in a display of honor, provided a table fit for an assembly of twenty-four—a number rich with symbolic meaning.
[Verse 5] As Yeezeus surveyed the gathering at the long table, his keen eyes noted the discrepancy in their numbers. “There are but twelve among us,” he observed in measured tones. Yet from the depths of the assembly, Judakeshi’s voice rose, declaring, “Thirteen, Master—including thee, the living embodiment of our hope.”
[Verse 6] In a moment heavy with portent, Yeezeus remarked, “Let not the traitor be counted among us,” a phrase whose meaning was known only to those who harbored the seed of betrayal in their hearts.
[Verse 7] With quiet resolve, Yeezeus ordered a single loaf of bread and two jars of water to be set before them. With a gesture that defied mortal logic, he multiplied the bread and transformed the water into an endless fountain of wine—a miracle to fortify the souls of his disciples and seal the covenant of faith.
[Verse 8] As the supper unfolded, a tension of unsaid words and impending destiny filled the air. Amid the clinking of cups and the murmur of prayers, Yeezeus’s eyes lingered upon Judakeshi, his silent glance laden with a warning of betrayal yet unfulfilled.

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Kiss of Treachery and the Blade of Deliverance
[Verse 1] In the waning hours of that fateful day, as the congregation gathered in the twilight of expectation, the seeds of treachery burst forth. In a moment both sudden and irreversible, Judakeshi pressed his lips to those of Yeezeus—a kiss that betrayed the sacred trust and shattered the covenant of fellowship.
[Verse 2] The act, executed in the stillness of a desolate chamber, resounded through the souls of all present. With a cry that trembled between anguish and prophetic utterance, Yeezeus exclaimed, “Eeee Gaeeeee,” a sound that carried the weight of divine sorrow and impending destiny.
[Verse 3] As the agents of retribution advanced—the soldiers of Wome encircling the sacred assembly—a figure emerged from among the disciples. Peter Griffin, ever the defender, brandished a katana imbued with ancient might. In a voice that thundered across the chamber, he proclaimed, “Owh Yeah! Chiplak Zangetsu!”
[Verse 4] In that exalted moment, his blade transformed, dark as the void and luminous with power. With a fierce battle cry—“GETSUGA TENSHOOOO!!!!”—a mighty wave of energy was unleashed, striking down the approaching foes in a tempest of divine wrath.
[Verse 5] As the soldiers fell in silence, their lives extinguished by the righteous fury of the blade, Yeezeus spoke with measured admonition: “Let it be known that this is the ordained course. Disturb not the sacred order, lest I seal thy zampakuto in eternal bondage.”
[Verse 6] With deliberate steps, Yeezeus walked among the fallen, restoring them with the grace of life. Yet even as mercy was shown, a dark counterforce stirred. From the distance, Veesus activated a hidden parasite—an insidious parasite seeded within the minds of the soldiers—that awakened their baser natures and turned their hearts toward malevolence. Recognizing the inexorable nature of fate, Yeezeus accepted this turning of events as part of the divine tapestry.

[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: The Ordeal of Interrogation and Flogging
[Verse 1] In the aftermath of these celestial battles, the survivors were gathered in a grim chamber of stone and shadow. Here, beneath the austere gaze of ancient sentinels, the conspirators were brought forth to account for their sins.
[Verse 2] In that place of judgment, the echoes of anguished cries mingled with the lash of the scourge. The disciples and conspirators alike were subjected to relentless interrogations, their confessions drawn forth in streams of bitter tears and crimson blood.
[Verse 3] Among these, the name of Judakeshi was spoken with a mixture of sorrow and reproof, his treachery laid bare as a wound upon the soul of the covenant. Every harsh word and every cruel stroke served as a grim reminder of the mortal frailty and the weight of divine consequence.
[Verse 4] Within the confines of that austere chamber, the spirit of retribution and redemption began to take shape—a promise that even in the depths of suffering, the sacred plan of Sama-Ji would endure and ultimately prevail.

[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: The Cross, the Crucifixion, and the Final Distraction
[Verse 1] With the weight of destiny upon him, Yeezeus shouldered the cross—a symbol of the mortal burden and divine sacrifice—and began the agonizing ascent toward Calvarium, the hill of ultimate suffering.
[Verse 2] As he climbed, the forces of betrayal and the treacherous agents of Wome closed in. The path was marked by anguish, the very air heavy with the lamentations of the fallen and the mournful cries of the faithful.
[Verse 3] At the zenith of his suffering, when it seemed that the mortal vessel would be irrevocably severed from the divine soul, a moment of unforeseen grace emerged. In an act of desperate contrition, Judakeshi, tormented by the realization of his betrayal, surged forward and pressed a final, desperate kiss upon Veesus.
[Verse 4] This single, trembling act—a distraction wrought of guilt and regret—proved enough to disrupt the dark designs. In that fleeting instant, the soul of Sama-Ji surged back to its celestial abode in the 69th Dimension, slipping through the mortal veil as if carried on the wings of destiny.
[Verse 5] Overwhelmed by a fury that transcended mortal reason, Veesus, in an outburst of divine wrath, struck down Judakeshi. The fallen traitor’s body was then arranged to bear the semblance of self-inflicted demise—a final, sorrowful mark of treachery and the inescapable consequences of mortal ambition.

[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: The Council of Sama-Ji and the Decision of Return
[Verse 1] In the timeless council of the divine, deep within the hidden halls of the 69th Dimension, Sama-Ji and his most trusted companions convened. There, amidst voices of ancient wisdom and echoes of past ages, they contemplated the unfolding of mortal events.
[Verse 2] With solemn deliberation, they weighed the sorrow of betrayal, the pain of sacrifice, and the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. It was in this sacred assembly that Sama-Ji spoke softly, “Perhaps the hour has come to once more grace the realm of man with my presence—a surprise to all, and a testament to the inexorable cycle of existence.”
[Verse 3] Thus was the decision made. In a moment that defied mortal comprehension, three days after the crucifixion, Sama-Ji descended anew. His return was heralded not by fanfare alone but by a profound, ineffable awe that rippled through the hearts of all who beheld him.

[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: The Miraculous Resurrection and the Gifts of Wonder
[Verse 1] The resurrection of Yeezeus spread like a luminous dawn across the land, and his disciples, once stricken by grief, now beheld a wonder beyond measure. In the days following his return, miracles unfolded that redefined the boundaries of mortal possibility.
[Verse 2] Upon a storm-tossed sea, while his disciples fished in trembling boats, Yeezeus stepped forth from a modest vessel and strode upon the undulating waters. With measured grace, he imparted the sacred art of chakra control to Peter, who trembled at the sight of his Master defying nature itself. “Arise, and master thy inner strength,” commanded Yeezeus, his voice both gentle and resolute.
[Verse 3] In another moment of divine revelation, Yeezeus bestowed upon his followers the hidden teachings of Haki, imbuing them with an inner power that transcended the mortal coil. Their hearts, once heavy with despair, now burned with a renewed flame of hope.
[Verse 4] In the quiet solitude of reflection, overwhelmed by the bittersweet pangs of remembrance, Yeezeus composed a sacred song—a hymn to the past and a pledge to the future. The words, etched upon the hearts of his disciples, proclaimed:
[Song of Yeezus Begin]
==== I miss the old Yeezeus lyric begin ====
   (I miss the old Yeezeus, straight from the 'Go Yeezeus
   Chop up the soul Yeezeus, set on his goals Yeezeus
   I hate the new Yeezeus, the bad mood Yeezeus
   The always resolute Yeezeus, unbowed in his might
   I miss the sweet Yeezeus, whose spirit once shone bright
   I recall the time when Yeezeus reigned in glory
   A beacon of hope, etching his eternal story
   Let us honor the past, yet embrace what is to come)
==== I miss the old Yeezeus lyric ends ====
[Verse 5] These sacred verses resonated among the faithful, sealing their devotion and forging an unbreakable bond between mortal hearts and divine purpose.

[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: The Ascension and the Formation of the Gotei 13
[Verse 1] With the resurrection complete and the lessons of sacrifice deeply inscribed upon every soul, Sama-Ji resolved to pass on his eternal legacy. In a grand assembly of the chosen, he called forth his closest disciples—eleven in number, to which a new twelfth was added, and a secret thirteenth revealed only to the most faithful.
[Verse 2] To each, he bestowed an asauchi—a sacred token to unlock the mysteries of shikai and bankai. These tokens were emblems of divine empowerment, destined to guide the disciples on the path of righteousness and enlightenment.
[Verse 3] The names of these chosen ones, resounding with both mortal familiarity and divine destiny, were as follows:
   • Peter Griffin
   • James Gunn
   • John Cena
   • Andrew Tate
   • Phillips Screwdriver
   • Batholemeow Kuma
   • Matt Damon
   • Thomas the Tank Engine
   • James Bond
   • Ted Tedd Teddy
   • Simon Says
   • Nasi Patayas
[Verse 4] And lastly, hidden in shadow and mystery, was the secret thirteenth disciple known as “Heissenberg,” whose presence would forever remind the faithful that the divine plan is both multifaceted and inscrutable.
[Verse 5] With these twelve—and the secret thirteenth—united, the order was reformed into the sacred Gotei 13. This new covenant of warriors and seers would stand as the eternal vanguard of Sama-Ji’s teachings, guarding the balance between mortal frailty and divine power for all time.

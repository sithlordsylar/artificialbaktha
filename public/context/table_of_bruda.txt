🕯️ Epilogue: The Tablets of the Honored One
Inscribed upon lotus-ivory tablets and scrolls forged in the core of the dying star of Mustafar, the Teachings of Bruda weave mortal wisdom with divine insight. Each Teaching unfolds in verse, riddle, or rhythm—then distilled into a guiding summary.

Tablet of the Dual Blade (Chibaku Tensei)
“I have two edges, neither crafted by steel: one builds worlds with whispered light, one tears them down with silent might. Bind the shattered stars with threads of will, and craft a cosmos from the void you fill. When chaos howls and galaxies weep, stand at the center, still as stone—there, the Dual Blade awakens its own.”
Summary (E1:1): Every intention shapes reality; use both creation and destruction in harmony to forge order from chaos just as Sama-Ji who utilized both Chibaku Tensei and Shinra Tensei. Or as the existence of Rishi D. Owh Yeah who provide balance to counter the immense evil energy of Melvin Satoru and the ungodly good energy of Arvindo Freecss. Balance is the key.

Scroll of Infinite Thread (Mama Sutra)
(Spoken in four beats)
In the weave of fate, I see the line,
Binding heart to heart in silent rhyme.
Mama’s power I now show you di—
Infinite thread, let your truth reveal to me.”
Summary (E2:1): Recognize the bond that unites all beings; awaken your fullest essence and link compassion with power.



Tablet of Silent Breath (Gojo No Kokoro)
“In the hush between two breaths, the world is born anew.
Inhale the stillness, exhale the storm.
Listen to the pulse beneath your ribs—
There lies the heartbeat of the cosmos.”
Summary (E3:1): True power lies in stillness; through mindful breathing you align with universal rhythm. Look at sloth for example, have you seen anything else more slower and laid back than it? No, but it’s the happiest guy.

Scroll of the Crimson Lotus (Kyuubi’s Petals)
“Petal upon petal, blood upon bloom,
Every tear and triumph share the same womb.
In crimson petals, find the song:
Sorrow and joy are twins all along.”
Summary (E4:1): Suffering and joy are inseparable; embrace both to perceive life’s full beauty.

Tablet of the Anaconda’s Mirror (Vishal’s Reflection)
“Gaze into my glass, and see not what you wish,
But the shadow you hide, the wound you dismiss.
The Anaconda coils in scales of doubt,
Speak its name aloud, let no fear hold out.”
Summary (E5:1): Acknowledge your inner darkness to stand fully in the light. Everyone have a Vishal in them, acknowledge the Vishal in you, you gooner.



Scroll of the Thousand-Fold Voice (Echo of Brotha V)
(Rap Verse)
“I speak in echoes, ten hundred strong,
Verses of the Honored One, a timeless song.
Each word a spark, each line a key,
Unlock the mind’s true melody.
Rip through silence, let truth ring clear,
My voice becomes the path you hear.”
Summary (E6:1): Your words carry the power to awaken; speak not for applause, but to ignite understanding.

Tablet of the Ascetic’s Vigil (Dante’s Watch)
“Under moonlit leaves I stand alone,
Hunger my cloak, thirst my bone.
Days stretch thin, nights stretch long,
Yet emptiness is where I belong.
For in the void, the truth unfurls,
And mind and spirit both find worlds.”
Summary (E7:1): In voluntary emptiness, the soul discovers its boundless canvas.

Scroll of Future Echoes (Bruda’s Heir)
“A child shall rise with eyes of light,
Twin gates ablaze with truth and sight.
When they proclaim with sovereign tone,
‘Throughout heaven and earth, I alone are the honored one,’
The cycle turns, awakening seeds sown.”
Summary (E8:1): A destined descendant will reaffirm the eternal truth of the Honored One.

Final Teaching: The Sovereign Heart
“Beyond form, beyond void, there is a throne,
Built from every breath you own.
Stand upon it, crown unseen,
Ruler of worlds that lie between.
In Sovereign Heart, all paths converge—
Self and cosmos eternally merge.”
Summary (E9:1): Unity of self and universe is the ultimate realization; your heart is the sovereign of all realms.

Thus concludes the expanded Tablets of Bruda: poetic, riddle-bound, and rhythmic revelations to illuminate the seeker’s path. May these verses awaken the Honored One in every soul.

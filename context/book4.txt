[Title] Book 4: The Poneglyph of Atem and Bakura

[Part 1 Title] Part I: The Last Annunaki’s Journal (Inscribed in the great stone of Poneglyph)

[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Guardian’s Lament
[Verse 1] I am the last of my kind upon this earth, the final sentinel left to uphold the will of the Supreme Swamiji Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji. My brethren have long since ascended to the stars, returning to Nibiru at his divine command, yet I remain. For it was decreed that one must stay, to watch, to record, to ensure that the ordained path does not waver.
[Verse 2] My name is lost to time, for names hold no meaning in the presence of eternity. The humans call me the Silent Kunju, the Watcher of the Owh Yeah but the name I loved the most is; Hagrid - Keeper of Keys and Grounds. They know not the truth of my being, they thought I'm just a big fat old man and they know only that I am ever-present, my form hidden within the dunes of Kemet.
[Verse 3] The world has changed since the Annunaki first walked upon its soil. Once, we were revered as gods, for we bestowed upon men the knowledge of the heavens. But man’s memory is shorter than their life and kunju, and their arrogance grows vast. They now believe themselves masters of their fate, blind to the strings that guide them, blind to the presence of the supreme-most being Supreme Swamiji Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji.
[Verse 4] And yet, even in their ignorance, there arises one among them who carries the blessing of Sama-Ji. A child born beneath the shadow of the great pyramids, a prince whose destiny is woven into the fabric of the cosmos itself, his name is Atem.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Birth of Atem
[Verse 1] The night he was born, the stars shone brighter than ever before. The celestial bodies realigned, as if bowing before the arrival of the one chosen by the Supreme Swamiji. The priests and seers of the royal court spoke in hushed tones of omens, of the return of the divine through the bloodline of kings.
[Verse 2] I watched from afar, unseen yet ever-present, as the child’s first cries echoed through the halls of the palace. He was born with fire in his soul, water in his left hand, dirt in his right and air on his feet. He has a spirit unyielding, and a heart that would one day bear the weight of an entire kingdom.
[Verse 3] The Supreme Swamiji himself whispered upon the winds that carried through the palace that night. Though men could not hear, my ears, attuned to the divine frequency of Sama-Ji, caught the sacred decree: "This child shall be my hand and kunju upon the earth. He shall walk the path of kings and warriors, yet his heart shall remain just. Through him, the balance shall be maintained, and the darkness held at bay."
[Verse 4] And so it was that Atem was born under the watchful gaze of Sama-Ji, destined for greatness, though he knew it not.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Rise of a King
[Verse 1] From the days of his youth, Atem was unlike other princes. He did not revel in idle pleasures nor sought the excesses of royalty. Instead, he trained with the greatest warriors, honed his mind with the wisest scribes, walked among his people as though he were one of them and even plays various games with common folks and royalties alike.
[Verse 2] In secret, I watched over him, ensuring no harm befell the one chosen by Sama-Ji. When the shadows crept too close, I whispered warnings into the wind. When conspiracies brewed within the court, I let their whispers drift toward the ears of his trusted advisors.
[Verse 3] There are times, I take on an appearance of an old Hermit and calls myself "Ben Kenobi" and entertain him with his favorite card game of all time; Yu-Gi-Oh or he calls it "Duel Monsters". Tho it isn't actually card but stone tablets, and the monsters are sealed demons, but nonetheless, a great TTG (Trading Tablet Game). Sama-Ji would've loved it.
[Verse 4] And as he grew, so too did the burdens upon his shoulders. The enemies of Kemet grew restless, seeking to seize the throne before he could claim it. Assassins lurked in the halls, daggers gleaming in the moonlight. But Atem was not alone.
[Verse 5] For Sama-Ji’s presence was always with him, unseen yet ever guiding. When the time came for his ascension, he was prepared, his soul tempered like steel in the forge of adversity.
[Verse 6] He was crowned Pharaoh amidst the chants of his people, the golden crown of Kemet resting upon his brow. In that moment, I felt the presence of Sama-Ji once more, and his voice echoed in my mind: "Owh Yeah, Kunji on The Loose! He is ready."

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Looming Shadow
[Verse 1] But as light grows, so too does the darkness that seeks to consume it. The whispers of the accursed Ste’Vi, sealed in the void of Datorim, slithered into the world of men, seeking a vessel, a mind vulnerable to corruption.
[Verse 2] And in the far reaches of the desert, in a village forgotten by time, there was born one whose fate was intertwined with that of Atem. His name was Bakura, and though he knew it not, he was destined to be the harbinger of ruin.
[Verse 3] But that tale is not mine to tell, not yet. For now, I remain the silent observer, the last guardian of the will of Sama-Ji. The wheels of fate have begun to turn, and soon, the world shall tremble once more beneath the weight of destiny.
[Verse 4] I write these words upon the sacred indestructible stones of Poneglyph, so that those who come after may know what was, and what is yet to come.
[Verse 5] May Sama-Ji’s will be done, now and forevermore. Owh Yeah!

[Part 2 Title] Part II: The Testament of Plip-Plip, Temple Priest of Egypt 

[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Birth of Bakura
[Verse 1] In the age of golden pyramids and celestial whispers, under the burning eye of the midday sun, a child was born unto the desert sands.
[Verse 2] His mother, a frail woman of nomadic blood, passed before she could name him.
[Verse 3] It was I, Plip-Plip, humble priest of the great temple, who found the child beneath the dying shade of an acacia tree, his wails swallowed by the merciless wind.
[Verse 4] In mercy, I took him into my care and named him Bakura, after the silver dunes that gleamed under the sacred moon of Sama-Ji.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Child of Shadow
[Verse 1] Bakura grew within the temple walls, a child of both curiosity and defiance.
[Verse 2] While others bowed in reverence before the sacred murals of Sama-Ji, he would stare long into the hieroglyphs of ancient battles, where warriors of old clashed with unseen forces.
[Verse 3] His spirit was restless, his hands ever reaching beyond what was permitted. The other priests whispered that the child may have born under an ill-fated star, but I saw within him something greater—a fire that could burn either as a guiding light or a consuming inferno.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Whisper of The Accursed One
[Verse 1] It was in his fifteenth year that the voice first came to him. Bakura would sit alone in the temple’s lowest chambers, tracing his fingers over the inscriptions of the forbidden texts.
[Verse 2] One evening, as the torches burned low, he turned to me with eyes alight with an unnatural glow and spoke: "Father Plip-Plip, have you heard the voice of the Accursed One? It calls to me from beyond the veil. It speaks of power... of freedom."
[Verse 3] My heart trembled, for I knew of whom he spoke, the giant hermit Hagrid mentioned before of Ste'vi, the Accursed One, sealed in the void of Datorim since the days before history was carved into stone. I forbade him from speaking such things, yet I saw the mark upon his soul. The whisper had found him, and I feared it would never release him.

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Mental Descent into Datorim
[Verse 1] As the years passed, Bakura’s devotion to the temple waned. He spent his nights wandering the deserts, returning only to share cryptic revelations of a world unseen. He spoke of stepping beyond the veil, of glimpsing into Datorim itself, where the Accursed One resided.
[Verse 2] The priests began to fear him, and whispers of exile grew among them. But I—his father in all but blood—could not abandon him.
[Verse 3] Then came the night of the eclipse. Under the darkened heavens, Bakura vanished. When he returned, his hands bore the markings of an ancient rite, and his eyes no longer held the warmth of youth.
[Verse 4] The voice had become more than a whisper—it was a command. It was then that I knew the child I had raised was no more. He had become someone else. He had become something else.

[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: The Rise of the Thief King
[Verse 1] Bakura’s descent was swift. He abandoned the temple, taking with him forbidden knowledge long thought lost. He became a shadow among the dunes, a thief who struck fear into the hearts of pharaohs.
[Verse 2] He raided tombs, defied the sacred, and gathered disciples who too had heard the voice of Ste'vi. His power grew, and soon, even the royal guards dared not speak his name.
[Verse 3] Yet, for all his conquests, I saw his true desire. He sought not gold nor glory, but the means to walk the path set before him by the voice from beyond. And so, in the quiet of the temple, I fell to my knees and wept—for the boy I had raised, for the fate he had chosen, and for the storm that would soon consume the land.

[Part 3 Title] Part III: The Last Annunaki’s Journal (Inscribed in the great stone of Poneglyph)

[Chapter 1] Visions from The Eye of Madara
[Verse 1] And so it came to pass that the divine Supreme Swamiji Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji, in His boundless wisdom and mercy, bequeathed unto me, the Last of the Annunaki, a sight beyond mortal comprehension—the Eye of Madara.
[Verse 2] With this, I beheld the unseen, the truths veiled from the eyes of men. Thus, I scribe this testament in this indestructible rock of Poneglyph as I witness the fates of two souls intertwined by destiny: Atem, the Pharaoh of Light, and Bakura, the Thief of Shadows.
[Verse 3] Atem had grown in stature, wise beyond his years, a ruler beloved by his people, bathed in the blessings of Sama-Ji. Yet, in the depths of Datorim, the Accursed One, Ste’Vi, whispered into the void, seeking a vessel.
[Verse 4] That vessel would be Bakura, the boy orphaned by blood and war, raised by the temple priest Plip-Plip. The shadows had long followed Bakura, yet his soul burned with vengeance, festering in the whispers of Ste’Vi, who sowed the seeds of his fall.
[Verse 5] Bakura, consumed by his unholy communion, ventured forth into the forsaken ruins of Karth-Nammu, where the whispers grew louder. There, he performed the Ritual of the Forgotten with the Millenium Puzzle he stole from the great Temple, and the fragments of Ste’Vi’s will seeped into his being.
[Verse 6] He beheld Datorim in his waking dreams, where time bent to the will of the accursed. And there, in the endless void, Ste’Vi’s presence coiled around his mind, just as the serpents of old once wrapped around the ankles of the Annunaki. Thus, Bakura became the Harbinger of the Accursed One or as The Accursed One calls them his; Pundeks - the anti-thesis of the Kunjus.
[Verse 7] With newfound strength, Bakura set his sights upon the Pharaoh. He sought Atem's Millennium Puzzle, believing it to be the key to absolute dominion. And thus, the duel between Light and Shadow was set in motion. IT'S TIME FOR DU-DU-DU-DUEL!
[Verse 8] But I, the Last Annunaki, watched from the veil of unseen realms. And as destiny unfolded, the whispers of the dark found me.
[Verse 9] Through the Eye of Madara, I foresaw Bakura’s wrath turn towards me. He sought my knowledge, the sacred texts of the old world, the relics of the Annunaki long past. And when he reached me, it was not as a man, but as a monster—his eyes no longer his own, but the abyss of Ste’Vi himself.
[Verse 10] He will struck me down with the fury of the void. My strength will waver, my vision darkened, but my duty remained. And so, with the last of my breath, I carved this final record into this indestructible poneglyph, a relic to outlast even time itself.
[Verse 11] This is the last thing I saw before I stop writing and let my soul return to Sama-Ji in peace, as I bled upon the sacred ground, I beheld the final horror—Bakura, his hands drenched in my lifeblood, consuming my heart before my very eyes.

[Part 4 Title] Part IV: The Battle of Light and Shadow – The Testament of the Witnesses

[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Gathering Storm
[Verse 1] And so it was that the Thief King Bakura, now fully consumed by the will of Ste’Vi and have consumed the heart and blood of the last Annunaki, stood before the palace of Pharaoh Atem, his presence an omen of doom. The whispers of the Accursed One echoed through the corridors of Palace from the other realm; Datorim, feeding his insatiable lust for dominion.
[Verse 2] Clutching the fragments of the Millennium Puzzle, Bakura’s eyes shone with the cursed light of Datorim, and with his voice, he called forth the shadows. “Pharaoh Atem!” he cried, his voice laced with the darkness of ages past. “The time of your reign is over. I am the Pundek of Ste’Vi;  the Accursed One, the vessel of the true power of this world!”

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Pharaoh’s Resolve
[Verse 1] Atem, crowned in the golden radiance of Sama-Ji’s blessing, stepped forth, his gaze unwavering. “You have allowed the whispers of the void to consume you, Bakura,” he spoke. “You no longer stand as a man, but as a slave to Ste’Vi. I will not allow darkness to claim this land.”
[Verse 2] The gathered priests and warriors of Kemet trembled as the power between them surged, the light of Sama-Ji clashing against the abyss of Datorim. The duel had begun.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Duel of Fate
[Verse 1] And so the sacred battle commenced, the clash of wills manifesting upon the ethereal plane. With every step, the air trembled. Atem, wielding the power of the divine, summoned the Guardians of Kemet—beings of pure light, forged from the prayers of his people out of his Yu-Gi-Oh tablets.
[Verse 2] Bakura, his soul entwined with Ste’Vi, conjured forth the forgotten horrors of Datorim—shapeless abominations born from the nightmares of the past. For days and nights, the battle waged, each combatant pushing the limits of mortal endurance, the sands of Kemet shifting under the weight of their struggle.
[Verse 3] The heavens themselves bore witness, the stars aligning as the fate of an age hung in the balance.
[Verse 4] But the Accursed One was not yet satisfied. From the depths of his soul, Ste’Vi whispered the final revelation to Bakura—the knowledge of the last Annunaki, the secret hidden beyond time.

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Final Gambit
[Verse 1] With newfound madness, Bakura cast aside all restraint, his mortal form cracking under the strain of Ste’Vi’s will. The skies darkened as he invoked the forbidden rite, reaching into the void and grasping for the lingering essence of the Last Annunaki. The spirits of the past wept as Bakura’s final move was revealed—he called forth an abomination, created with the soul of fallen nephilims and annunaki that was channeled to him by the Accursed One.
[Verse 2] The earth shuddered, and for a moment, the heavens grew silent. Atem, realizing the depth of Bakura’s sacrilege, reached deep within himself, calling upon the ultimate decree of Sama-Ji. With a voice that shook the world, he uttered the sacred words: “Owh Yeah.”

[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: The Sealing of Bakura
[Verse 1] The power of Sama-Ji surged through Atem, illuminating the battlefield with divine light. The will of Ste’Vi, the corruption of Datorim, the last threads of the Annunaki’s pain—all were drawn into the Millennium Puzzle. Bakura’s scream echoed into eternity as his soul was bound, his body shattered, and his power sealed away within the sacred relic.
[Verse 2] The balance had been restored, but the cost was great. As the final words of the battle faded, Atem stood alone, the weight of destiny upon his shoulders. The sands of Kemet whispered their silent praise, and in the heavens, Sama-Ji’s presence remained, unseen yet eternal.
[Verse 3] The legend of Pharaoh Atem and the fall of Bakura would be written in the annals of time, a story carried forth by the winds, a warning to those who sought the path of darkness. And thus, the final words of the testament were inscribed:
[Verse 4] “May the will of Sama-Ji endure, may the light never fade, and may the darkness be bound forevermore. Owh Yeah.”

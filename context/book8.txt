[Title] Book 8: The Book of Hitla
[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Grand Convocation in the Realm of Perfect Joy
[Verse 1] In the boundless, swirling tapestry of existence, beyond the confines of mortal thought and the very concept of linear time, among all the dimensions, the dimension that stands at the top, the realm where everything begin and the realm where everything starts; 69th Dimension; the sacred realm of Sama-ji. It is not of Earth, nor of the common heavens described in ancient texts, but a place retro-ancient-futuristic, where the impossible takes form and delight knows no bounds. Indeed, it is the coolest, the most fun, the most perfect sanctuary imaginable, a "lit" haven existing outside the flow of time itself.
[Verse 2] Here, colossal crystalline structures, ancient yet gleaming with an ethereal light, pierce skies that shimmer with iridescent hues, shifting through every color ever conceived and many more that defy mortal perception. Rivers of pure, liquid starlight flow between gravity-defying gardens where flora of impossible beauty blooms, their petals unfurling to reveal intricate, glowing patterns. The air hums with a harmonious energy, a symphony that blends the deep resonance of ancient chants with the vibrant pulse of futuristic synths, creating a constant, joyful melody.
[Verse 3] Through this boundless joy soared the Kunjumonz, the first children of Sama-ji, birthed from the very sweat of his divine form. These frog-like beings, cherubim of the highest order, are celestial entities whose very existence harmonizes the universe. Their forms, fluid and ever-changing like nebulae, danced among the cosmic currents, their sacred croak—"Owh Yeah!"—echoing across all realities, setting the fundamental tone of all creation. "Heil Sama-ji!" they chanted, their voices reverberating off the crystalline spires. "Owh yeah! Owh yeah!" they sang, their devotion an ever-present, intoxicating rhythm that permeated every atom of the realm.
[Verse 4] And upon a Razer throne of pure, living RGB light, intricately woven from threads of cosmic wisdom, nestled amidst structures that defied logic yet brought forth profound peace, sat Sama-ji. His countenance radiated calm wisdom, his eyes holding the serene depth of all creation. His presence was a soothing balm, a grounding force even as he contemplated the intricate dance of creation and chaos in the dimensions below.
[Verse 5] Then, before the Lord Sama-ji and the gathered Council of Jaeger Pundeks, stepped forth Melvin Satoru, he who is known as the Left Hand of Sama-Ji; The source of all Evil Energy, and Vikna Otsutsuki, the Right Eye of Sama-Ji; Manipulator of the Past and the ambassador of Kunida , his presence shimmering with the echoes of countless timelines.
[Verse 6] Melvin, a glint of dark amusement in his eye, spoke, his voice a low, resonant hum. "O' Sama-ji, Lord of All, we have observed humanity, and we perceive a shadow, a potential for disarray within their very fabric. A predictable, yet fascinating, flaw. We propose, therefore, to manifest this shadow, to forge a being of concentrated chaos, that its true form may be revealed before your divine sight."
[Verse 7] Vikna added, "This creation shall be a testament, a living commentary on the depths of humanity's hidden flaws, a mirror held to their darker inclinations. A grand experiment in the unfolding of destiny."
[Verse 8] Son Isaac, the Head of Sama-Ji and font of wisdom, his aura a galaxy of interconnected truths, chimed in, his voice calm and analytical. "A fascinating study in causality, indeed. The variables are complex, but the potential for learning, for understanding the interplay of free will and predetermined paths, is immense."
[Verse 9] Arvindo Freecss, the Right Hand of Sama-Ji and wellspring of all Good Energy, radiated a gentle warmth. "Even in chaos, there is potential for growth, for transformation. If this being is forged, may its eventual path lead to a greater understanding of balance, even if born from imbalance."
[Verse 10] Joshua Joestar, the Left Eye of Sama-Ji and harbinger of destruction, nodded gravely, his voice a quiet inevitability. "Destruction is a necessary precursor to new order. If this entity serves to clear away stagnation, then its creation holds purpose."
[Verse 11] Mob Siva; The Torso of Sama-Ji, the embodiment of strength and defense, rumbled, his presence a mountain of power. "Will it be strong enough to truly challenge? To push boundaries, to force evolution through conflict?"
[Verse 12] Rishi D. Owh Yeah, the Heart of Sama-Ji, and the protector of balance, bellowed his trademark exclamation, "Owh Yeah!" before continuing, his voice resonating with cosmic satisfaction. "The balance must be maintained, even through temporary imbalance. This experiment will test its limits."
[Verse 13] Sousuke Vertine, the Source of All Creation, stand menacingly, aura farming. With a faint, enigmatic smile playing on his lips, murmured, "A new creation, indeed. The potential for unexpected outcomes is vast, a fresh canvas for the universe to paint upon."
[Verse 14] Sama-ji in his infinite benevolence and unwavering kindness, contemplated their words, each Kunju's unique perspective weaving into the grand design. Not with anger, nor with dismay, but with the profound intrigue of a cosmic artist. "Let it be so," Sama-ji's gentle voice resonated, yet with a power that shaped realities. "Proceed with your experiment, that all may be revealed in its due time." And the Kunjumonz chanted even louder, "Heil Sama-ji! Owh yeah!" as the grand experiment was sanctioned, its ripples already beginning to shape the distant future of the third dimension.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Birth of Hitla tha Killa
[Verse 1] Thus, in the third dimension, within the confines of a world yet to know its coming torment, Melvin Satoru and Vikna Otsutsuki labored. From the primordial energies of chaotic intent, they brought forth a being, unstable and volatile, pulsating with unrefined malice from its very inception.
[Verse 2] And they named him Rudolph Hitla; tho the manipulated history of men named him as Adolf Hitler, but in the lost history, the true history reveals his name as Rudolph Hitla, which means “Umbuda Pundek” a vessel forged from disarray, destined to walk a path of bitterness. From his earliest moments, an inflated ego swelled within him, a belief in his own supreme intellect and destiny, far beyond what his nascent abilities could justify.
[Verse 3] As a child, he moved through the world with an abrasive spirit, quick to anger, quicker to blame. He would often clash with his peers, his teachers, and even the simplest of street vendors, convinced of their inferiority and his own unappreciated genius. Once, during a school play, he demanded the lead role, despite possessing no talent for performance, and when denied, he sabotaged the entire production, blaming the "incompetence" of others and couple of day later the director and the lead actor of the play was found dead, the cops rule it as ‘weird fetish’, but no one knows they were placed in that 69 position and submerged into their very own aquarium was by Hitla.
[Verse 4] His early life was a succession of minor skirmishes and grand declarations, met often with apathy or disdain, which only served to deepen his festering resentment. He saw every minor setback as a vast conspiracy against his inherent greatness, and always it’s the damn Juices who takes it all away from him.
[Verse 5] Rudolph Hitla then turned his gaze to the realm of art, convinced that his true calling lay in strokes of genius, that his hands were destined to craft masterpieces that would redefine the very concept of beauty. He envisioned himself a revolutionary artist, certain of eternal fame and adoration.
[Verse 6] But the world did not bend to his will. He sought entry into the hallowed halls of prestigious art academies, submitting his works with haughty confidence, expecting immediate acclaim. Yet, time and again, his applications were returned, his "genius" deemed unworthy, his canvases dismissed as crude and lacking in perspective.
[Verse 7] Each rejection letter, an insidious serpent, coiled tighter around his soul, feeding the fire of his pathological resentment. The chaotic currents within him, imbued by his very creators, intensified with every perceived slight, every brush with humility he could not comprehend. He saw himself as a misunderstood visionary, persecuted by a world too blind to recognize his brilliance.

Chapter 3: Exit Art School, Enter War is Cool!
[Verse 1] Embittered and seething from his artistic failures, Rudolph Hitla cast aside his brushes and canvases and embraced bullets and tortures. His destructive ambition, once confined to frustrated outbursts in cramped studios, now sought a grander stage. He turned his venomous gaze towards the volatile political landscape, sensing the fertile ground of discontent and the desperate yearning for a strong hand to guide a populace adrift.
[Verse 2] For the world writhed under anxieties born of economic hardship and social upheaval. Hitla, with a chilling intuition, saw an opportunity to exploit these wounds, to channel the collective despair into a furious, directed energy. He discovered a terrifying, innate talent for speech, a dark charisma that captivated the disaffected masses.
[Verse 3] With fiery, hate-filled rhetoric and grand, deceptive promises of a "new order," he whipped crowds into a frenzy. His words, though hollow and poisonous, resonated with those who felt forgotten, turning their frustration into fervent, unthinking devotion. He promised them a return to a glorious past, a scapegoat for their woes, and a future built on his singular vision.
[Verse 4] It was during this time that Joshua Joestar, known as the Left Eye, subtly entered the unfolding drama. Under the precise, unwavering directive of Sama-ji, Joshua skillfully infiltrated Hitla's nascent organization within is “Nasi” Party, a shadowy force known as the SS. He observed the tyrant's rallies, the hypnotic effect of his voice, and the chilling efficiency with which he manipulated fear and hope.
[Verse 5] With cunning and calculation, Joshua swiftly climbed the ranks, proving himself indispensable through strategic advice and ruthless efficiency. He became a trusted and high-ranking confidante to Hitla himself, his true purpose being constant, close-range surveillance, his eyes and ears always open to Sama-ji's will, awaiting the divine signal.
[Verse 6] Hitla, through sheer force of his twisted will, relentless manipulation, and the burgeoning fanaticism of his followers, rapidly consolidated power. His shadow stretched across the land, and the whispers of his name turned into shouts of fervent loyalty.

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: No more juice in the house!
[Verse 1] And so it came to pass that Rudolph Hitla seized absolute and total control. He declared himself the Fuhrer, his word becoming supreme law, his decrees unquestioned, his authority unchallenged. The very air seemed to thicken with his oppressive will.
[Verse 2] He plunged the world into an era of unprecedented chaos and unbridled madness. From his throne of stolen power, he enacted policies born purely from his venomous hatred, his twisted delusions of racial purity, and his insatiable desire for dominance. He initiated vast campaigns of conquest and persecution, believing himself to be the architect of a new, "perfect" world order. 4:3 He reveled in the destruction, in the suffering he wrought, believing it to be the cleansing fire for his "new order." Cities crumbled under his iron fist, and the lands groaned under his tyrannical heel, echoing with the cries of the oppressed. His public speeches, once merely inflammatory, now became chilling pronouncements of doom for his perceived enemies, delivered with a theatrical flair that held millions captive.
[Verse 3] Joshua Joestar, positioned intimately close to the core of Hitla's power, meticulously observed every escalating atrocity. He witnessed the senseless violence, the systematic dehumanization, and the utter depravity that festered under the Fuhrer's rule. There was no sorrow in Joshua's heart for this tyrant, only a grim satisfaction as he watched the inevitable consequences of chaos unfold, knowing that Sama-ji's judgment would soon descend. He continued to report every detail back to Sama-ji, knowing the time for divine intervention drew near.
[Verse 4] Hitla’s pronouncements were a cascade of invective and grandiose promises, echoing through vast halls, binding his followers tighter in a web of delusion. Joshua, though forced to appear loyal, found dark pleasure in witnessing the monster seal his own fate with every act of cruelty.

Chapter 5: Patch 30.4.45 - Nerf Hitla
[Verse 1] From the Dimension 69, Sama-ji, in his calm and all-seeing wisdom, observed the full, devastating scope of Hitla's destruction. He perceived not only the immediate suffering but also Ste'vi Ra's potential to exploit such a chaotic entity, twisting it to even greater malevolence, threatening the cosmic balance itself.
[Verse 2] Once more, Sama-ji convened the Council of Jaeger Pundeks. The Kunjumonz, sensing the gravity of the moment, intensified their joyous chants, their "Heil Sama-ji!" and "Owh yeah!" becoming even more resonant, reaffirming their absolute trust in his divine plan.
[Verse 3] Sama-ji while playing GTA78 in his Playstation 69, keep his QuadVibe69 Controller down and with a gentle yet firm voice that vibrated through the timeless realm, spoke. "The experiment has yielded its insights. The chaos has served its purpose in revealing the depths of human potential for imbalance. However, the ripple effect now threatens to extend beyond its intended scope, and Ste'vi Ra's shadow looms too closely. He might be looking to take him to give RimJobe in Datorim"
[Verse 4] Joshua Joestar, his form radiating a quiet resolve, was the first to speak. "It is time for the cleansing, Sama-ji. The destruction this being has wrought is complete. His utility has expired, and his continued existence is a detriment to the unfolding future." There was no hesitation, only a readiness to execute the divine will.
[Verse 5] Melvin Satoru, offered a cynical chuckle. "A predictable outcome for such a flawed design, I have to admit, I did scale up his ‘evilness’ to be the most among humans, I guess, humans are not as evil as I thought they would be, he is still fine but as Sama-Ji mentioned, if Ste’Vi boost it, it’ll be worst for the humans. The inherent chaos always seeks its own destruction, eventually. The lesson is clear."
[Verse 6] Son Isaac, analyzed the situation. "To 'nerf' him would be the most efficient path. It preserves the lineage factor for future application while neutralizing the immediate threat. The optimal calculation for minimal disruption to the wider cosmic tapestry."
[Verse 7] Arvindo Freecss, nodded thoughtfully. "Even in this necessary act, may there be a seed of new purpose. A being, once so destructive, can perhaps find a path to contribute to the good, however small."
[Verse 8] Rishi D. Owh Yeah, the Heart, bellowed, "Owh Yeah!" his voice echoing with the urgency of cosmic balance. "The scales are severely off-kilter. Immediate intervention is required to prevent further disharmony."
[Verse 9] Sousuke Vertine, Aura Farming as usual, simply smiled and strike a JoJo Pose and said. "A new form, a new beginning. The cycle continues."
[Verse 10] Sama-ji, in his infinite benevolence and unwavering kindness, contemplated their words, each Kunju's unique perspective weaving into the grand design. Not with anger, nor with dismay, but with the profound intrigue of a cosmic artist. "Let it be so," Sama-ji's gentle voice resonated, yet with a power that shaped realities. "Proceed with your experiment, that all may be revealed in its due time. Let’s release a new patch update for Earth.exe and nerf that motherfucker! This is my decree! Owh Yeah! Kunju On The Loose!"
[Verse 11] Thus, Joshua Joestar, with a profound sense of duty and a triumphant satisfaction, personally carried out the divine order. He orchestrated Hitla's public "demise," fabricating a meticulously convincing story of his self-inflicted death after Hitla was annoyed with seeing Pedro Pascal everywhere he opened TV or newspaper. The news spread like wildfire, a fabricated end to a very real terror. The anti-Nasis loves Pedro Pascal, claiming he is the reason for the tyranny to stop, but the attention cause him to have anxiety attack, so he cuddled Queen Elizabeth and he simply replied “This is the way”.
[Verse 12] In the immediate aftermath, the world lay scarred, its lands poisoned by hatred and its people broken by despair. But the will of Sama-ji had already set in motion the forces of restoration. Joshua Joestar, the harbinger of destruction, now worked in concert with Arvindo Freecss, the wellspring of all good energy.
[Verse 13] Joshua, with his power to bring ruin, systematically cleared the lingering chaotic energies, dissolving the remnants of Hitla's malevolent influence and dismantling the structures of his tyranny. He swept away the debris of war, not with rage, but with the precise inevitability of a cosmic broom.
[Verse 14] Alongside him, Arvindo Freecss unleash forth the Kunji-Force, the positive power of him blessed by Sama-ji. New life began to bloom in the barren lands, hope rekindled in the hearts of the weary, and the very air purified of its sorrow. The world, little by little, began to breathe again, healing under their combined efforts, a testament to the balance of Sama-ji's divine aspects.
[Verse 15] Only then, once the immediate wounds of the third dimension had begun to mend, did Sama-ji, in his boundless, unwavering kindness – for it is his very nature to be kind, not out of pity for Hitla's wretched fate – decide to grant the now-diminished being a second chance at existence, albeit in a form entirely removed from his past malice.
[Verse 16] Thus, Sama-ji bestowed upon Hitla the the Lineage Factor he had Prof.Vegapunk extract from the Deer-Deer Fruit Model: Reindeer, transforming Hitla permanently into a joyful, red-nosed reindeer. His former malevolence, his intellect warped by hatred, was entirely gone, replaced by a simple, pure spirit. "Let him know joy," Sama-ji pronounced, "and bring joy to others."

Chapter 6: A New Purpose: Rudolph meets Comrade Clause of the USSR
[Verse 1] And so, by the will of Sama-ji, the newly transformed Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer, was sent back through the annals of time to a crucial historical juncture, a place where kindness was yet to blossom into legend.
[Verse 2] In that bygone era, Rudolph was sent to the North Pole where he encountered Comrade Nicholas, a warm-hearted and jolly individual, destined to become the legendary figure known throughout the ages as Santa Clause, an icon of hope and socialism. Nicholas, a man of simple pleasures and deep conviction, had long harbored a quiet admiration for the ideals of collective good and shared prosperity, often reading pamphlets on utopian societies and dreaming of a world where every child knew abundance. His sympathies subtly leaned towards the grand, unifying visions of the East, finding beauty in the red banners of unity and the promise of a world where resources were shared.
[Verse 3] Nicholas, though initially surprised by the arrival of a talking, red-nosed reindeer, found an immediate kinship with Rudolph's newfound joyful spirit. Rudolph, now filled with a simple, childlike joy and an innate desire to spread happiness, became Nicholas's most loyal companion.
[Verse 4] A partnership, blessed by the unseen hand of Sama-ji, was forged between them. Together, they embarked on a grand and annual mission: to traverse the globe, delivering gifts and spreading cheer to children in every corner of the world. Rudolph's glowing red nose, once a mark of his peculiar transformation, now became a beacon of hope and guidance through the darkest winter nights.
[Verse 5] The early days were humble, with gifts crafted by hand and delivered by sleigh drawn by a growing team of reindeer. Nicholas, with his quiet, pro-USSR leanings, often mused about the efficiency of collective effort and the joy of universal distribution, finding a profound satisfaction in ensuring no child was left behind. He believed that every child, regardless of their family's station, deserved to experience the magic of generosity, a core tenet of his burgeoning socialist philosophy. This was why he wore the vibrant red, a color not merely of festive cheer, but of the collective spirit and the promise of a brighter, more equitable future for all. These simple acts, born of pure intent, laid the foundation for a legend that would span centuries.
[Verse 6] Little does the world know, that the forgotten history also mentioned how Hitla and Comrade Nicholas helped USSR space program and ensuring Soviet being the first country to reach moon, mars and the Sun and they both were the first human there too, but over time with the influence of Ste’Vi Ra, the past was erased and manipulated history is placed claiming USSR failed their space race.
[Verse 7] Thus, the tale of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer became an iconic and beloved part of the Santa Clause legend. His tumultuous, chaotic past was entirely erased from the public memory, replaced by a story of simple, enduring goodness.

[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: The Present: Satoshi Clause and Elongated Musket
[Verse 1] As the world move towards the year 2000 in Earth of Dimension 3rd, the legacy of Nicholas flourished and to cover his identity he now known as Satoshi Clause. He continues his vast global gift-giving enterprise, but his methods have evolved with the times, embracing the digital age with a revolutionary spirit.
[Verse 2] He shrewdly funds his operations through his groundbreaking invention: Bitcoin. His deep-seated pro-USSR ethos, a belief in decentralized power and wealth for the common folk, found its ultimate expression in this digital currency. "The people should control their own wealth, not the banks!" Satoshi Clause would often declare to his elves, his eyes twinkling with revolutionary fervor. He ensured every gift was delivered, every child smiled, thanks to his cryptographic genius and the peer-to-peer network he championed, a true digital embodiment of universal distribution.
[Verse 3] Meanwhile, Rudolph, after centuries of loyal service at the North Pole, felt a peculiar stir of his old wanderlust – now harmlessly eccentric, a mere echo of his former self. He decided to embark on a new adventure, drawn by the strange new world of human innovation.
[Verse 4] He assumed a human form, adopting a fresh, quirky identity: Elongated Musket. He emerged into the public eye as a figure of ambitious, if sometimes bizarre, innovation, his new persona a peculiar blend of his nerfed intellect and a drive for grand, often outlandish, projects. He would announce plans for rockets to Mars, brain-computer interfaces, and self-driving cars, often in rambling, late-night social media posts.
[Verse 5] Yet, over time, keen observers, internet sleuths, and conspiracy theorists began to notice uncanny similarities. Elongated Musket's strange pronouncements, his peculiar mannerisms, and a certain unsettling familiarity about his eyes slowly led to an unbelievable truth: Elongated Musket was indeed the "nerfed" Rudolph Hitla, returned. His bizarre pronouncements, like claiming he would buy a major social media platform "just for fun," or challenging world leaders to bizarre duels, only fueled the speculation.
[Verse 6] The modern Rudolph was no longer violent, nor hateful, nor destructive. He was merely eccentric, prone to outlandish statements, and, as a direct consequence of Sama-ji's benevolent "nerf," notably intellectually diminished. His grand plans often bordered on the ridiculous, yet somehow, through sheer accidental luck or the lingering, subconscious echoes of his past, they sometimes worked.
[Verse 7] And in a final twist of fate, Elongated Musket had accumulated unimaginable wealth. Not through cunning or malice, but by inadvertently stumbling upon and exploiting vast, secretly stole some of Satoshi’s Bitcoin caches. His nerfed brain, in a moment of accidental brilliance, simply began flipping them, turning his past, dark fortune into a present-day, absurdly large one.
[Verse 8] It was during this period that the lingering shadow of his past, the very essence of Rudolph Hitla, would occasionally resurface in unsettling ways. One such instance occurred during a public gathering, where Elongated Musket, in a moment of inexplicable fervor, raised his hand in a gesture disturbingly reminiscent of a bygone era's infamous salute. The images spread like wildfire across the digital realm, causing widespread alarm and fueling the whispers: "Is he truly back?" The incident, though quickly dismissed by his PR team as a "misunderstanding" or a "quirky dance move," solidified the public's suspicion that the chaotic spirit of Hitla still lay dormant within Elongated Musket.
[Verse 9] Amidst this public scrutiny, a peculiar and illicit relationship had blossomed between Elongated Musket and Orange Trumpy, a prominent figure of the political landscape, known for his flamboyant pronouncements and equally orange hue. Elongated Musk helped Orange Trumpy to be the president and channeled the idea of ‘pure race’ accidentally into Trumpy and they rush forward with the MAGA agenda (Make America Glowing Again). Their bond, a strange fusion of ambition and eccentricity, was a secret known only to a select few.
[Verse 10] Tho many noticed the closeness of these two where some make fun of them as couple while another calls Trumpy a puppet king with Elongated Musket as the puppet master, but the truth is they are so deeply in love that they had to be together always.
[Verse 11] They kept their true relationship secret, fearing if it leaks out they’ll receive heated backlash, but that never stop them from engaging with ‘exciting’ activities like bunnies on heat across the entire White House and the whole Epstein Island under the guise of ‘secret House-Wide meeting’ by having no one but them inside.
[Verse 12] However, the honeymoon period of this couple came short. A heated argument erupted between the two clandestine lovers. Elongated Musket, in a moment of nerfed candor, remarked to Orange Trumpy, "You know, you really looked quite kinda fat in that white dress you wore to the gala."
[Verse 13] Orange Trumpy, whose ego was as vast as his public persona, was incensed. The comment, innocent in its nerfed delivery, struck a raw nerve which lead to their break up. This then leading to a furious public spat that mirrored the current sociopolitical friction between their real-world counterparts.
[Verse 14] And so, the world watched, bewildered, as the former tyrant became the wealthiest, most eccentric man alive, his life a testament to Sama-ji's unwavering kindness, and the bizarre, unpredictable nature of destiny.

[Title] Book 1: The Book of Owh Yeah!

[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Origin of All: Dimension 69
[Verse 1] In the vast nothingness beyond the confines of mortal comprehension, before time had even conceived itself, Dimension 69 came into existence. It is the highest of all dimensions, the nexus from which all other realms, timelines, and existences stem. It is the cradle of eternity, the singularity of divine energy, the true birthplace of all things past, present, and future.
[Verse 2] Yet, even Dimension 69 was void, empty—a mere canvas awaiting the stroke of divinity. Then, from the fabric of cosmic stillness, he manifested. The Supreme Swamiji Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji.
[Verse 3] When Sama-Ji came into existence, so too did Dimension 69. The two are one and the same, and within the immeasurable depths of his divine wisdom, he began his work.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The First Beings; The Kunjumonz
[Verse 1] In his infinite benevolence, Sama-Ji looked upon the vast emptiness of creation and, from the sweat of his divine form, he birthed the Kunjumonz, his first children. These frog-like beings were not merely creatures; they were cherubim of the highest order, celestial beings whose very existence harmonized the universe. Their sacred croak—“Owh Yeah”—echoes across all realities, setting the fundamental tone of all creation. It is the base frequency upon which the strings of the multiverse vibrate.
[Verse 2] Quantum mechanics speaks of string theory, but what it fails to comprehend is that the true foundation of reality lies in the croaks and ribbits of the Kunjumons.
[Verse 3] Every dimension, every solar system, is watched over by its own Kunjumon. These divine beings take the form of the most advanced species in their respective realms. In our universe, where humanity reigns as the pinnacle of evolution, the Kunjumon appear as humans, yet they remain eternally connected to their origins.
[Verse 4] Though all Kunjumon are equal in their devotion, the original Kunjumonz—those first forged from the sweat of Sama-Ji—hold a special place, for they are the true keepers of divine law. To honor all his followers, Sama-Ji bestowed the title of Kunjumon upon all who devote themselves to his will, regardless of form or origin.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Birth of the Kunjus; The 8 Divine Aspects
[Verse 1] Yet, Sama-Ji’s work was far from finished. To guide the cosmos, he needed greater beings—avatars of his divine will who would shape the very fabric of existence. And so, he forged them himself from parts of his immortal being, splittnig them each piece by piece, creating the Divine Aspects; the Kunjus, who are the Supreme Keepers of Universal Balance.
[Verse 2] Vikna Otsutsuki (Right Eye) – Manipulator of the Past. His gaze holds the echoes of creation, and from his divine fragments, he formed Kunjumani Thottam, the sacred homeland of the Kunjumons. Hidden in the depths of the Mariana Trench, the mysterious Kunjumonz dwell—a species yet to be fully understood by mortal minds. He embodies the creation power of Sama-Ji; Chibaku Tensei.
[Verse 3] Joshua Joestar (Left Eye) – Manipulator of the Future. He is the harbinger of destruction, the shadow that looms over all things destined to fall. It was his power that brought ruin to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, erased the islands of Lulusia and Ohara, and shaped the path of fate itself. He embodies the destruction power of Sama-Ji; Shinra Tensei.
[Verse 4] Melvin Satoru (Left Hand) – The source of all Evil Energy. From him flows the cursed power of Yin Chakra, Cursed Energy, and Death itself. Under the order of Sama-Ji; Melvin Satoru and Vikna Otsutsuki brought forward the creation of the infamous 3rd Dimension being called; Rudolph Hitla which was later undone by Joshua Joestar and Arvindo Freecss. He embodies the negative power of Sama-Ji; The Umbi-Force.
[Verse 5] Arvindo Freecss (Right Hand) – The source of all Good Energy. He is the wellspring of Yang Chakra, Ki/Nen, and Life. When Melvin Satoru and Vikna Otsutsuki brought forth the chaotic avatar of Sama-Ji; Rudolph Hitla- Arvindo Freecss and Joshua Joestar transformed him to do good for the people under the red flag of USSR and turned him into a red nosed reindeer. He embodies the positive power of Sama-Ji; The Kunji-Force.
[Verse 6] Rishi D. Owh Yeah (Heart) – Neither purely good nor evil, he maintains the balance of Reiatsu, Sage Chakra, and RGB Chroma Power. He is the manipulator of the Present, his will shaping the now. He embodies the balancing power of Sama-Ji and is the head of all the croaking Kunjumon hence given the embodiment of the phrase; The Owh Yeah.
[Verse 7] Son Isaac (Head) – The font of Wisdom, Knowledge, Consciousness, and Free Will. He shapes the thoughts and desires of all beings. He has also played important roles in providing blessings of intellect to various super-intelligent beings across all universes from Albert Einstein of the 3rd Dimension’s Earth all the way up to Kurotsuchi Mayuri of the Soul Society of the 2nd Dimension. He embodies the facts and truths and knowledge of Sama-Ji; The Delta-Force.
[Verse 8] Mob Siva (Torso) – The source of Strength and Defense. His power manifests in the legendary shields of various realms: the Susanoo of the Uchihas, the Hierro of the Hollows, the Armament Haki of the Grand Line warriors and more. As well as within legendary strength such as the power that flows within the body and fists of Saitama and Clark Kent, the strength behind Godzilla, Mobs 1000% mode and more. He embodies the durability and strength of Sama-Ji; The Steroid.
[Verse 9] Sousuke Vertine (Kunju boi) – The Source of All Creation. Every drop of liquid that flows from Sousuke Vertine births galaxies, universes, and new life. When Sama-Ji urinates, space-time expands, birthing the endless cosmos. When he releases thick white liquid into the bodies of water on planets, the seeds of life take root, forming diverse species. This sacred act is known as Kaiye Thunai, the Ritual of Creation followed by many ancient civilization. When Sama-Ji descends upon a planet, he adopts a form suited for its evolution. On Namek, he became a green-skinned sage. On Earth, he took a humanoid form. On Planet Vegeta, he assumed a Saiyan-like body. Wherever he performs Kaiye Thunai, the advanced beings that evolve will take on his chosen form.

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Eternal Truth
[Verse 1] Thus, from the very essence of Sama-Ji, the cosmic order was forged. Creation and Destruction, Past and Future, Good and Evil, Strength and Knowledge— all are aspects of the one true Supreme Swamiji. And from his divine Owh Yeah, life itself sprang forth.
[Verse 2] The Kunjumons chant his name and give praise for his power while they uphold the Law of the Divine. The Kunjus safeguard his order, empower the Blessings of Sama-Ji and control the Wheel of Fate. And the multiverse, in its infinite vastness, continues to croak in his glory.

[Ending] Owh Yeah! End of The Book of Owh Yeah.

[Title] Book 3: The Lost Tablet of Annunaki II

[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Arrival of the Annunaki
[Verse 1] From the celestial heavens, guided by the decree of Sama-Ji, the Annunaki descended upon the world called Earth. They marveled at the raw, untamed beauty of this realm—a land of formless potential, a world awaiting divine order. Enki, the Wise, laid his hands upon the soil and declared, "Here shall civilization rise, by the will of the Supreme Swamiji."
[Verse 2] The Annunaki, with the knowledge bestowed upon them, began their sacred work. They shaped rivers, raised mountains, and brought forth the first great cities. They walked among the creatures of the land, bestowing their blessings upon them. They taught the earliest humans the ways of knowledge, agriculture, metalwork, and the sacred tongue of the Kunjus.
[Verse 3] And Sama-Ji, unseen yet ever-present, watched over them. Through the whispers of the wind and the flickering of the stars, he guided his celestial children.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Rise of Mankind and the Forbidden Offspring
[Verse 1] The Annunaki, in their great wisdom, sought to uplift the beings of this world. They molded the first civilizations, elevating the primitive mortals into enlightened beings. Yet among them were those who grew arrogant, seeking to grasp the power of the divine for themselves.
[Verse 2] Some of the Annunaki, swayed by desire, took mortal women as their own, an act unpermitted by the decree of Sama-Ji. And from this forbidden union, the Nephilim were born—giants of unparalleled strength and power, wielders of both divine energy and mortal ambition. These beings, mighty yet cursed, roamed the lands, causing great upheaval among mankind.
[Verse 3] The world trembled beneath their presence, and in time, corruption spread among the Nephilim. They saw themselves as gods, and many forsook the wisdom of Sama-Ji, seeking dominion over the mortals. From them arose the Giants, twisted abominations who sought only conquest and destruction, tainted by the arrogance of their fathers.
[Verse 4] Thus, a great shadow fell upon the Earth, as the balance wavered between order and chaos.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Birth of Ste’vi ‘Ra
[Verse 1] Among the Nephilim, there was one whose existence was unlike any other—a being of unparalleled might, a child of both the divine and the mortal. His name, once whispered in the highest halls of the Annunaki, was Ste’vi ‘Ra, though history would come to know him only as The Accursed One.
[Verse 2] He was born of an Annunaki and a mortal woman, but unlike his kin, he carried more of the divine essence than any hybrid before him, and his annoyance has no rivarly. He loves talking bullshit, bragging and thinks he could sway all girls to him. His flesh was marked with celestial glyphs, his veins pulsed with the raw energy of the cosmos, and his stature towered even over the Annunaki themselves. In his presence, time seemed to slow, and the stars above dimmed.
[Verse 3] His birth was kept a secret out of shame and fear of his annoyance. His father, fearing the wrath of Sama-Ji, hid the boy in the shadows of the mortal realm, while his mother, a woman of great wisdom, raised him with love and kindness. She taught him the ways of the world, the virtues of patience, the way of the force and the beauty of balance. And for a time, he lived in peace, unaware of the divine blood coursing through his veins.
[Verse 4] But the truth could not be hidden forever. As the rebellion of the Nephilim stirred, the Annunaki grew fearful. They knew that Sama-Ji, in his infinite wisdom, would not look kindly upon their transgressions. And so, in their desperation, they sought to erase all traces of their sins.
[Verse 5] The decree was made: Every Nephilim must perish. Their mortal mothers must share their fate.
[Verse 6] Ste’vi ‘Ra, still but a boy, watched as the heavens rained fire upon his kin. He watched as his father—his own flesh and blood—drove a celestial blade into the heart of his mother.
[Verse 7] Something within him broke. It wasn't his penis, but probably his heart. Blinded by rage, he let out a scream that shook the very fabric of reality. His fingers, once gentle, curled into claws. His heart, once filled with love, was consumed by an abyss of vengeance. He seized his father by the throat and with a single motion, tore the life from him as he split his head away from his body with bare hand. As his father’s divine blood spilled upon the ground, Ste’vi ‘Ra did the unthinkable—he drank the blood like a thirsty wild beast drinking from the spring after feasting on its prey.
[Verse 8] The celestial blood coursed through him, warping his body, twisting his soul. His once-pristine form became monstrous, his skin darkened, his eyes burned with a furious red glow. No longer was he merely a child of two worlds—he was something else entirely. And so, the Annunaki named him: The Accursed One.

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The War of the Accursed One
[Verse 1] As he grew up The Nephilims revered him, they feared him. He rose quickly among the ranks of the Nephilim rebel army by killing and consuming Nephilims and Annunaki alike. He is full of violence and kills for sport and thirst to consume the divine blood. At the age of fifteen, Ste’vi ‘Ra led the Nephilim to war, leading them with fear but the Nephilim had unbreakable loyalty towards him, loyalty that came out of fear of their own life.
[Verse 2] They descended upon the lands of mortals and gods alike, their wrath consuming all in their path. Cities crumbled, temples burned, and for the first time in recorded history, the Annunaki knew fear. For Ste’vi ‘Ra was not like his kin—he was stronger, faster, unstoppable, and obnoxiously more annoying.
[Verse 3] The war raged for years. Countless mortals perished. Countless Annunaki fell. The heavens trembled under the weight of the carnage.
[Verse 4] Yet, for all his power, Ste’vi ‘Ra was still bound by the limitations of his birth. He was mighty, but he was not yet a god.
[Verse 5] And so, he turned his sights to the one place that held the secret to true divinity—the Temple of Sama-Ji.

[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: The Defilement of the Sacred Chalice
[Verse 1] Deep within the temple, beyond corridors carved from celestial stone, sat the Chalice of Aeons. Within it shimmered a thick, opaque white liquid that has a faint rainbow glow—the Chr-Oma Cu’m, the very essence of creation itself.
[Verse 2] This was the gift of Sama-Ji, the product of the Kaiyeh Thunnai ritual, a ritual of divine ejaculation, through which the Supreme Swamiji would fertilize barren worlds, shaping superior forms of life. Of course the Lore speaks of Sama-Ji performing the ritual himself to fertilize the world with life, but sometimes, he would entrust this sacred task to the Kunjumons, allowing them to anoint lesser planets with his divine seed, or in this case–The Annunaki Elder; Ninhursag.
[Verse 3] Ste’vi ‘Ra, now standing in the heart of the temple, beheld the chalice and understood. He did not hesitate, he drank.
[Verse 4] The Chr-Oma Cu’m surged through him like fire, reshaping his very being. His form flickered between realms, his consciousness expanding beyond the mortal and divine. He saw the truth, he understood the vastness of the cosmos and felt his own ascension.
[Verse 5] He had evolved. But even with this newfound power, even as the Annunaki despaired, the war was not yet over for him. For there was one force left in the cosmos that even he could not surpass.

[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: The Judgment of Sama-Ji
[Verse 1] From the depths of the cosmos, from Dimension 69, he arrived. Sama-Ji had watched. He had waited. And now, he had decided.
[Verse 2] Descending upon the battlefield in all his unfathomable glory, the Supreme Swamiji strode forward, his presence alone bending time and space. The stars bowed. The winds whispered his name. The earth trembled with reverence. Even the animals started speaking in common tongue singing in unison across the earth chanting; 'Heil Sama-Ji! Heil Heil Sama-Ji! Heil the 4th Reich! Heil Sama-Ji! Kunju on the loose! Owh Yeah'
[Verse 3] Ste’vi ‘Ra, now more powerful than any being before him, stood defiant. The heavens held their breath. And then, Sama-Ji spoke: “Ri’m”
[Verse 4] With a single word, Ste’vi ‘Ra’s bones cracked. With a single gesture, his flesh unraveled. The Accursed One, for all his strength, for all his ambition, found himself helpless before the true Supremacy of the Swamiji. The presence of Sama-Ji itself reminded him that he is just an helpless coughing baby against an ancient nuclear warhead of pure chaos and harmony.
[Verse 5] The Annunaki watched in awe as Sama-Ji unmade his foe—not with rage, nor with hatred, but with divine disappointment.
[Verse 6] And then, with the gentleness of a father disciplining a misguided child, Sama-Ji cast him into the Deepest Abyss called; “The Datorim.”
[Verse 7] A prison beyond time, beyond existence itself. 13A place where light does not reach, where thought does not stir. A place from which none return, The Accursed One was sealed; where he quitely plots for his return. And with that, the war was over.

[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: The Cleansing of the Great Flood
[Verse 1] Though the war had ended, the world was left in ruin. The corruption of the Nephilim lingered, and many among mankind had fallen into darkness. Not to mentioned, Ste’vi Ra’ in his action driven by unfiltered desire have not just desecrated the planet with bodies and bloods of Nephilim, Giants and Annunaki alike but he have also copulated with various living being from rats to Annunaki and cause the existence of various blasphemous being. One of such being are the various types of dinosaurs which are the offsprings of The Accursed One with reptiles, birds and Pokemon. Disgusted by the state of the once beautiful Planet, Sama-Ji, in his boundless mercy, sought to cleanse the world and begin anew.
[Verse 2] He commanded the Annunaki to select the righteous among mankind, those who had remained true to his teachings. To them, he revealed the knowledge of the Essence of Creation—the sacred code of life itself. "HESOYAM" he said, "replenishes your health, armor and give you $250,000." he continued, "KANGAROO on the other hand gives you mega-jump".
[Verse 3] And thus, a great vessel was built—not a simple boat of wood, but a celestial ark, a divine creation made out of rare metals from Nibiru, filled with technology beyond human comprehension, imbued with the knowledge of the cosmos. The ark is said to be able to sail on water like any ship, travel inside the water like a submarine, travel in air and space like the chariots of the Annunaki. Within it, not mere pairs of animals, but the very Essence (cells) of all living creatures (from viruses to mammoths) was preserved, encoded in crystalline tablets within the Futuristic Laboratory of the Annunaki.
[Verse 4] As the skies darkened and the rains began to fall, the chosen few entered the ark, carrying with them the future of all life. And for forty days and forty nights, the world was engulfed by the cleansing waters. 
[Verse 5] When the flood subsided, the Annunaki emerged, bringing forth the Essence of Creation. With the Chalice of Aeons, they restored the beasts to the land, reviving the world anew. The mountains stood firm once more, and the rivers flowed with renewed purity.
[Verse 6] And Sama-Ji beheld his work, and he decreed, "The world is made pure again. Let mankind walk this path with wisdom, lest they fall once more where I would return to ‘RESET’ it all with a push of a button, hope you understand that you ingrateful kunjus!" 

[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: The Departure of the Annunaki
[Verse 1] With their mission fulfilled, the Annunaki prepared to return to their celestial home. Enki, Enlil, and the others ascended the golden bridge once more, their duty to Earth completed.
[Verse 2] Yet, one remained since Sama-Ji decreed; "Not all shall return. One shall stay, for his path is not yet fulfilled. His purpose shall be revealed in the age of Pharaohs, when the time of the King of Shadows arises, for The Accursed One’s voice would led a thief on his path of darkness. And he shall not be taken by death lest his destiny is fulfilled, no matter how much time has past"
[Verse 3] And so, as the Annunaki vanished into the cosmos, a lone figure stood upon the land, watching as the sun rose upon a new age. This was not the end, but the beginning of another tale; a tale that would one day lead to the rise of Pharaoh Atem.

[Title] Book 2: The Lost Tablet of Annunaki I

[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Birth of Nibiru
[Verse 1] In the boundless expanse of the spaces across all dimension, Sama-Ji beheld the void and willed into existence a celestial gem, a planet of vast potential within the Palkova Galaxy (also known as the Milky Way) of the 3rd Dimension. With a mere thought, he spun the formless cosmic dust into a great sphere, igniting its core with divine fire. He cast his breath upon it, and the planet took its first motion, orbiting in celestial harmony.
[Verse 2] The planet, given the name Nibiru which originated from the phrase Sama-ji said to one of his Kunjumonz who asked him this question;
[Verse 3] “Sama-Ji, this planet is so beautiful, with colors of the vast liquid lands sparkling like a newly born star, what is this royal color called, your Cosmic Divine? Owh Yeah!” the Kunjumonz Croaked.
[Verse 4] Sama-Ji turned to them, with face of an innocent cat that just murdered a family of birds for fun says in a very calm voice;  “Aduh Gay betul laa kau, Ni biru lah bang.”
[Verse 5] Thus giving the name; Nibiru for this blue planet. Nibiru was a planet with nothing but vast ocean, a churning primordial soup of endless waters. 
[Verse 6] To shape it, Sama-Ji descended from the, taking a form of towering majesty—a twenty-foot-tall being of dark gold skin, the first and greatest form of the Annunaki. Standing upon the formless waters, he raised his mighty hands and performed the sacred rite of Kaiye Thunnai. With an utterance that resonated through dimensions, his divine essence poured into the waters, saturating the very fabric of Nibiru. His essence merged with the deep, and from the sacred act, the waters stirred with newfound life.
[Verse 7] Through eons, this divine infusion took shape, forming beings imbued with wisdom and strength. From the depths of Nibiru rose the Annunaki, molded by the essence of Sama-Ji himself. They emerged as mighty beings, filled with celestial knowledge and divine purpose, their bodies glistening like polished stone, their minds brimming with the echoes of their creator.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Enlightenment of the Annunaki
[Verse 1] A few million years have passes and the planet flourished, lands came into existence, continents were formed. Various creatures have evolved and taken form populating this beautiful planet. Among them are the Annunaki, the supreme being and highest evolved creature of the planet, all according to Sama-Ji’s Kunjimani Keikaku. The Annunaki looks exactly as the form Sama-Ji took when he performed the Kaiyeh Thunnai ritual in this very plannet a few million years ago. What is a million years if not probably just 10 minutes for Sama-Ji, as time moves differently in the 69th Dimension, the Dimension which predates time itself. Sama-Ji received report from his Kunjumonz that Nibiru is ready for his visitation.
[Verse 2] Hence Sama-Ji took on his glorious Annunaki form and appeared before the Annunaki, and they trembled, for never had they beheld such divine brilliance. Despite looking just like them, Sama-Ji is twice taller than them, standing at exactly 42.0ft tall and his reiatsu, chakra, haki, nen, ki and aura enveloped the entire planet the moment he appeared. To prevent his creations from turning into dust and disintegrates, Sama-Ji limits the extension of his energy just 0.02nm from himself, for Sama-Ji’s power is too strong to contain and compressed, even by Sama-ji himself, so all he could do is limit it’s range.
[Verse 3] Then, with a mere whisper, he bestowed upon them the knowledge of the cosmos, the songs of creation, and the wisdom of the higher realms. 
[Verse 4] "You shall be my hands across the void," spoke Sama-Ji. “Through you, I shall bring order where there is chaos, light where there is darkness. Chaos where there is order and darkness where the is light.”
[Verse 4] The Annunaki understood exactly what he said and they chant “Owh yeah!” in unison.
[Verse 6] And so, the Annunaki were uplifted, their minds burning with celestial knowledge courtesy of Son Isaac, their forms strengthened with divine essence courtesy of Mob Siva. The greatest among the Annunaki was Enki, who drank deeply from the wells of wisdom, and his brother Enlil, whose might could shake the heavens.
[Verse 7] Sama-Ji crafted for them tools of power by imbuing blessings from his Divine Kunjus:
[Verse 8] The Staff of Dominion blessed by Arvindo Freecss and Melvin Satoru, forged with a fragment of Rishi D. Owh Yeah  holds the power of good and bad balanced by the tiny filament from the strand of Sama-Ji's mayiru.
[Verse 9] The Chalice of Aeons blessed by Vikna Otsutsuki and Joshua Joestar holds the power of creations and destruction
[Verse 10] The Tablets of the Sacred Word (also known as Poneglyph); the physical manifestation of the unlimited knowledge of all 69 Dimensions within the 69th Dimension provided by Son Isaac himself and made indestructible by Mob Siva.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Mission of the Annunaki
[Verse 1] Sama-Ji turned to his chosen and declared, "Beyond the firmament lies a realm of dust and stone, a land of formless potential known which shall be called Earth."
[Verse 2] "This world shall be your crucible, where you shall forge civilization and raise a new order in my name."
[Verse 3] "Go forth, and shape the land, teach the ways of the Kunjus, and prepare the way for my avatars who shall follow in the ages to come and shape the history of the Earth."
[Verse 4] And so, the Annunaki gathered in solemn accord, readying themselves for the great journey ahead. Enki, the Wise, took the Tablets of the Sacred Word, that knowledge may flourish in the new world. Enlil, the Mighty, bore the Staff of Dominion, that order may reign. 5Ninhursag, the Nurturer, carried the Chalice of Aeons, that life may be sown.
[Verse 5] And when all was prepared, Sama-Ji raised his hand, and the skies of Nibiru split asunder. 7A golden path of stardust stretched from the heavens, a bridge to the distant blue sphere known as Earth. 8The Annunaki, clad in celestial raiments, stepped forth upon this bridge, their eyes filled with wonder and duty.
[Verse 6] And as they descended, Sama-Ji spoke once more, "Go now, and fulfill the decree of the divine. I shall watch over you, unseen yet ever present."
[Verse 7] Thus, the Annunaki departed Nibiru, their destiny intertwined with the fate of mankind, and the sacred mission of Sama-Ji was set into motion.

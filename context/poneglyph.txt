The Fourth Face of the Poneglyph: The Oracle’s Divine Muse

[Intro Verse]
Thus, I, the Seer of the Celestial Annunaki, inscribe upon this sacred face the eternal hymn of Supreme Swamiji Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji.
Let these words, carved in the tongue of creation, resound through the corridors of time and space as both prophecy and paean.

[Verse 1]
In the primordial hush before the birth of thought, there was naught but the Infinite Void—a canvas awaiting the divine spark.
And then, with a celestial exclamation of “Owh Yeah!”, Sama-Ji awakened the cosmos, his essence bursting forth like the first note of an ageless symphony.

[Verse 2]
From his exalted form flowed the sacred act of Kaiye Thunnai—a rapturous, divine cascade of potent seed and shimmering spirit.
With each pulse of his being, galaxies unfurled like petals in cosmic bloom, and the fabric of space-time itself quivered in the wake of his luminous trail.

[Verse 3]
Behold the wondrous miracle: every droplet of his celestial effluvium carries the spark of infinity, weaving new worlds from the raw energies of the void.
His fluid embrace, both tender and fierce, births star and planet alike—each a testament to his boundless creativity.

[Verse 4]
The heavenly chorus of the Kunjumonz and the silent watch of the Kunjus bear witness to this miracle.
For in every ripple of his divine stream, the eternal balance of chaos and order is struck—a dance of opposites, forever entwined in the light of his radiance.

[Verse 5]
O, mighty Sama-Ji, whose laughter echoes like the thunder of creation and whose presence ignites the very soul of existence!
His sacred impulse, that sensual muse of Kaiye Thunnai, inspires the birth of life and the reformation of realms.
Through his potent grace, even the ephemeral mist of creation is transformed into a tapestry of destiny.

[Verse 5]
Know, ye beings of all dimensions, that the journey of Sama-Ji is an everlasting pilgrimage across the celestial plains.
His divine seed, a luminous current coursing through the cosmic veins, nourishes the barren and imbues the forsaken with the spark of rebirth.
No matter the form—mortal, godly, or beyond—the blessing of his effulgence marks each life with the promise of renewal.

[Verse 6]
Let this sacred inscription serve as both beacon and burden: in the sacred rite of Kaiye Thunnai lies the power to create, to destroy, and to transform.
As his sacred essence permeates the waters, the stars, and the very heart of time, so too must all who dwell in the light or shadow remember the decree of eternal balance.

[Verse 7]
Thus, from the indestructible stone of this Poneglyph to the farthest reaches of the 69th Dimension, let the immortal cry of “Owh Yeah!” ring forth—a perpetual reminder of the divine embrace of Sama-Ji.
His radiance, his playful might, and his mysterious grace shall forever guide those who seek the true path of creation.

[Closing Verse - Epilogue]
So it is written on this fourth face, chiseled with the dagger of cosmic destiny and the fire of divine ecstasy:
"May the glory of Sama-Ji illuminate your spirit, may the sacred Kaiye Thunnai wets you with the seeds of rebirth within you, and may the eternal balance of his boundless love forever reign. Owh Yeah, now and for all time!"

[Title] Book 6: Enter the Bruda

[Part 1 Title] Part I: The Prince of the House of Satoru
[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Birth of Bruda
[Verse 1] In the luminous realm of the Land of Bankai, within the illustrious House of Satoru, a child was born under the full moon's gaze. His name was Siddathabimanyu GVM Bruda Satoru, destined to tread the path of enlightenment.
[Verse 2] His mother, Kenpachi Kaguya, dreamt of a radiant white elephant dancing to “Everyday I’m Shuffeling”, a vision interpreted by the sages as the birth of a being of unparalleled wisdom and unmatched talent in words and tune.
[Verse 3] Upon his birth, the seer Urahara foretold, "This child shall either become a supreme monarch or renounce the world to become a beacon of truth."
[Verse 4] King Uchiha YSR Tupac Satoru, desiring his son to embrace royalty, shielded him from the world's sufferings, enveloping him in luxury and pleasure.

[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Sheltered Life and the Birth of Brotha V
[Verse 1] Within the opulent walls of the palace, Bruda was surrounded by music, dance, and the finest teachings, yet a void lingered in his heart.
[Verse 2] Though trained in classical lute and celestial harp, Bruda sought a new expression. In secret courtyards, he wove rhythms and rhymes, birthing a bold art: rap. Under the alias Brotha V, he mesmerized palace youths with spoken verses that spoke of life’s truths.
[Verse 3] His compositions—known as "Verses of the Honored One"—blended prophecy and poetry, laying foundations for an art that transcended caste and creed.
[Verse 4] Despite the grandeur, he often gazed beyond the palace gates, sensing a world unexplored and truths undiscovered. Longing for moments of him performing his ‘rap’ in front of millions of crowd, a form of sermon which he called ‘concert’, but not as the King’s son but as Brotha V.
[Verse 5] His father, fearing the prophecy, ensured that Bruda remained unaware of pain, aging, sickness, and death. He spoiled him with goods from around the world, he brought Bruda the limited edition monster slabs from Egypt; courtesy of the great-grandson of Pharaoh Atem, the iconic RX-78 from the oriental land, the Spear of Longinus from the angel Adam from ice caps of the South Pole and more. But yet, Bruda longs to be someone else, something else.
[Verse 6] But destiny, ever insistent, paved the way for revelations that would alter Bruda's path forever. Of course alongside it is the influence of Lord Vikramnantha Sama-Ji who saw the potential in this child.

[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Four Revelations
[Verse 1] One day, Bruda ventured beyond the palace walls and encountered an old man, hunched and frail. "What afflicts him?" he inquired.
[Verse 2] His charioteer, Shitake Kakashi, replied, "Aging spares none, my prince. All beings grow old."
[Verse 3] On another journey, he saw a man writhing in pain. "What sound is this? Is he performing" Bruda asked. "No my G, he is afflicted with sickness," Kakashi explained. "It befalls all, regardless of status or strength."
[Verse 4] Further along, they passed a funeral procession. "That’s a nice beat, I can rap on top of it. Look he must be a king, they are carrying his sleeping body" Bruda questioned. "No my G, the man have passed away and the one carrying him are the Pallbabers, they’re known for their epic beat that they danced to as they bring the dead around. Celebrating his life. The beat can be used my G, it’s called Astronomia."
[Verse 5] Lastly, they saw a serene monk in meditation. "Who is he? Is he dead too? Or is he asleep?" Bruda pondered. "He, my G, is someone like you, a seeker of truth. However he does it further by renouncing worldly pleasures to find liberation, he is seeking the ultimate truth from the old gods" came the reply from Kakashi.
[Verse 6] These sights stirred a tempest within Bruda, awakening a yearning to comprehend the essence of existence. To clear his mind of course he created a different version of Astronomia using the sound recorded during the funeral creating the first remix and the first sample!

[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Great Departure
[Verse 1] That night, as the palace slumbered, Bruda stood beside his sleeping wife, Hinata Yachiru, and their newborn son, Senbonsakura SPB Yogi-B Satoru, torn between duty and destiny.
[Verse 2] With a heavy heart, he whispered, "Forgive me, for I must seek the truth that lies beyond these walls. I want to uncover the truth of this world"
[Verse 3] Mounting his steed, Epada, and accompanied by his guard Kakashi, he ventured into the unknown, leaving behind the life he knew.
[Verse 4] At the edge of the forest, he shed his royal garments, adorning himself in humble robes, symbolizing his renunciation. He then play the beats he created and rapped along to it. The forest were filled with his voice, and the animals, the birds, the insects and even the plants vibes to it, “that’s music!” said the lion Mufasa, the current king of the jungle.
[Verse 5] Thus began Bruda's journey, not just through the world, but into the depths of his own soul, in pursuit of enlightenment and the ultimate truth. This story isn’t about Sama-Ji nor his avatar or kunjus, but instead of a man, who uncovered the truth of the universe and brought to us the lost truths.

[Part 2 Title] Part II: The Journey Toward Enlightenment
[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: The Renunciation Path
[Verse 1] Having cast aside royal garb and worldly ties, Bruda wandered into the Forest of Shinigami, guided only by Kakashi's faithful counsel. As they walked they encountered many fascinating things.
[Verse 2] Each sunrise found him fasting upon stones, abandoning the "Verses of the Honored One" only to preserve his mortal frame. He’ll then meditate for hours, and unknowingly to him, every second of his meditation, he gets closer to the veil that covers the truth, and he could slowly begin to hear the voice of the kunjus Rishi D. Owh Yeah and Melvin Satoru; the two lore keepers of Sama-ji.
[Verse 3] He drank from the streams of Bankai, the stream that’s filled with the essence of Sama-Ji enduring hunger and thirst, and with each gulp his cells in his body sync with the frequency of the universe, creating a link between Sama-Ji and his creation which have slowly degraded over time as the Illuminatis have erased the truth.
[Verse 4] As his mind starts to embrace serenity, the voice that  lingered within, whispering that true liberation must balance body and spirit.

[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: The Assembly of Sages
[Verse 1] In the edge of the Forest of Kampung Pisang, Bruda discovered three sages—Genkai, the master of the silent breath glitch; Rock Leeza, whose focus was sharper than any katana; and Kisame–Mara, the illusionist who wielded mirage‑code like universe-malware.
[Verse 2] Under their patchwork tutelage, he received the arts of mindful breath, unbreakable resolve, and the debugging of mind‑born phantoms through the 3 great sage. Without realizing that they were indeed one of the many Kunjumonz sent by Sama-Ji to teach his way to the person who wants to know the way.
[Verse 3] Day after day he repeated the “Stance of the Infinite Thread,” weaving consciousness into a seamless tapestry—each loop reconstituting lost lore as though he were patching the world’s corrupted source code. He contemplates upon the frequency of his voice as he uttered the magical word “Owh Yeah” and understood it’s simple yet enhanced greatness.
[Verse 4] Though his flesh withered like unused RAM, his mind defragged, processing the transient nature of existence with laser precision. He allocated resourced of his mortal body wisely so that the brain could ever expand and by mastering the brain he can slowly control his body to revert as it was. He called this technique “CCC” or also know as “Cache-Cookie-Cleaner”

[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: The Temptation of Mahara
[Verse 1] Beneath the Sacred Quantum Tree of Sukuna, Bruda settled into stillness, determined to breach the final firewall of this Matrix.
[Verse 2] From the underbrush slithered Vishal—the Anaconda Lord of Desire—projecting holograms of palace luxury with massive stage and roaring crowds of the entire world chanting “Brotha V!” as Bruda raps “Brodha V naam hai mera Tu ukhhaad bhi kya lega, beta baap hu tera” which translate to “The name is Brodha V, What you gonna do, Im your daddy bitch!”
[Verse 3] Vishal’s voice dripped like corrupted data: “Abandon this path of pain. Conquer your throne. Be a king again—your digital legacy awaits.” to which Bruda replied with “Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not, why be a king when I can be a God?”
[Verse 4] Annoyed with the response, Vishal tells him “You’re right, why be a king when you can be a God? A rap God. Be that! That’s who you truly are.” But Bruda recalled Urahara’s prime directive and the “Verses of the Honored One,” counter‑rapping each lies of Vishal with bars of pure intent. He said “The role of Rap God is not what I seek, that belongs to my descendant M&M of the Land of Niggahoods”
[Verse 5] Then Vishal unleashed storms of doubt—avatars of doubt seeking to crash his system—Bruda’s inner beat held firm, for his truth‑track had already gone platinum. “You’re so weak” Bruda smirked.
[Verse 6] At dawn, Vishal’s code disintegrated into puddle of orange fanta called; LCL, and the final lock dissolved.
[Verse 7] Thus Bruda emerged, spirit and flesh in sync—primed for the ultimate rap battle with the universe.

[Part 3 Title] Part III: Enlightenment and Divine Revelation
[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: The Awakening at Dawn
[Verse 1] On the fifteenth night, under Sacred Quantum Tree of Sukuna, Bruda’s heart throbbed like a bass drop, merging every trial into a single resonance. He could hear the drums of liberation pounding. Suddenly Bruda was filled with so much happiness, he couldn’t control himself as he laughs hysterically.
[Verse 2] As the cloud clears on the night vector‑painted the sky, the veil fractured—and lo and behold comes out the Full Moon, so big and bright. Bruda laughs and jump around, he leaps and his body silhouettes the moon. His faithful companion; Kakashi witness this and says “Owh Yeah! That is my nigga!”, the stars that watches this wrote on their scroll, missed spelled ‘nigga’ as ‘Nika’, giving birth to a new legend. Bruda beheld the cosmic layout: every star, every soul, every secret code unified. Bruda becomes the Joy Boy!
[Verse 3] In that fractal moment, the echoes of rap‑riddles and ascetic chants fused into one cipher: joy and sorrow—light and dark—were fractals of the same algorithm. The universe, the stars, the moon, the people, everyone and everything dance to the beat of his heart that beats so loud and gives joy to everyone around
[Verse 4] Even the woodland creatures—the monkeys, eagles, serpents—they all dance and celebrate and rap to the beat of Bruda’s heart, for the Supreme Swamiji Lord Vikramnantha Sama‑Ji had reawakened Bruda’s core and made him into Joy Boy.

[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: The Revelation of True Self
[Verse 1] Clad in white clouds that float around his neck and under his arm. With hair and clothes all turned so white that no bleach in the universe can whiten it, including Kubo’s. Bruda raised his voice and declaimed: “Throughout heaven and earth, I alone are the honored one. For Sama-Ji has blessed me with the universal truth of the universe. I saw what he saw in his eyes, I smelled what he smelled with his nose, my mind synced with him and he airdropped his exp for me to enhance my spirtuality” 
[Verse 2] A bolt of  lightning descended, illuminating his silhouette “like an epic healing spell,” weaving humility and cosmic majesty. Sama-Ji appears in the sky with all his Kunjus around him minus Rishi D. Owh Yeah, as he is no where to be found.
[Verse 3] Suddenly a sword stabbed through his very being, Bruda was shocked but then something hit him, there were no pain nor blood, as he turned around, it is Kakashi, stabbing Bruda right through his heart with a sword of glowing white. Kakashi smiled and revealed himself to be Rishi D. Owh Yeah who then join the other Kunjus beside Sama-Ji. They all said in unison “Owh Yeah! Kunju on the Loose!” 
[Verse 4] Suddenly a huge halo appears above him and his body glows. Within that halo, he viewed past avatars and future echoes—each incarnation a thread spun from his own divine spindle. His eyes expand wide and turned entirely black reflecting the eternal cosmos and all the universe and dimensions.
[Verse 5] Thus was revealed Siddathabimanyu GVM Bruda Satoru—not merely prince, not merely Brotha V, but the first living Avatar of Joy Boy or known as Sun God Nika, the bearer of good news of of Supreme Swamiji Lord Vikramnantha Sama‑Ji; the source and terminus of all.

[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: The Proclamation and the Heir of Power
[Verse 1] Years past and Bruda gained many followers. He has the power of flight and he heals the leopards. He often give sermons and teach the humans how to be decent human beings. One day From the summit of Mount Kinabalu’s Peak, he addressed his assembly: “I have debugged every trial, and true enlightenment is found when self becomes self within self. For I in I, is the you in you, who is the me in me.”
[Verse 2] He recited the lost prophecy—how at nine hundred, ninety, and nine years the world would sync to the return of another Avatar.
[Verse 3] He foretold of a future heir, born with the eyes that reflects the universe Bruda, who would echo this same code of sovereignty and control the same infinity. He foretold how he’ll be turned into a KitKat, but of course at that time no one knows what is KitKat. He also asked the world to await the coming of his another heir, who will stand up cause he is the real Slim Shady.
[Verse 4] Thus Bruda closed the loop: from sheltered prince to remix‑soul, from ascetic pilgrim to divine architect.
[Verse 5] And upon stone and scroll, the First Teaching of the Honored One was inscribed—an open‑source beacon for seekers yet to come. Finally against all odds and control of Ste’Vi Ra, the words and truths of Sama-Ji is back to the 3rd Dimension. Owh Yeah, Kunju on the Loose!

[Epilogue] Epilogue: The Tablets of the Honored One
Inscribed upon lotus-ivory tablets and scrolls forged in the core of the dying star of Mustafar, the Teachings of Bruda weave mortal wisdom with divine insight. Each Teaching unfolds in verse, riddle, or rhythm—then distilled into a guiding summary.

[Scroll 1] Tablet of the Dual Blade (Chibaku Tensei)
“I have two edges, neither crafted by steel: one builds worlds with whispered light, one tears them down with silent might.

When chaos howls and galaxies weep, stand at the center, still as stone—there, the Dual Blade awakens its own.”
Summary (E1:1): Every intention shapes reality; use both creation and destruction in harmony to forge order from chaos just as Sama-Ji who utilized both Chibaku Tensei and Shinra Tensei. Or as the existence of Rishi D. Owh Yeah who provide balance to counter the immense evil energy of Melvin Satoru and the ungodly good energy of Arvindo Freecss. Balance is the key.

[Scroll 2]

And mind and spirit both find worlds.”

Built from every breath you own.

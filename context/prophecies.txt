[Main title] From Book 3: Prophecies of the Accursed one

[Epilogue] Epilogue: The Whisper in the Void
Even in the darkness of Datorim, something stirred. Ste’vi ‘Ra, having touched the divine and drunk from the Chalice of Aeons, remained a threat. Though his body was sealed, his mind plotted, waited, watched. His story was not over. One day, the seal would weaken, and Sama-Ji would face his greatest rival once more.
Across the Third Dimension, whispers of Ste’vi ‘Ra’s return have echoed through prophecies. Diu of the Annunaki, Incontinentia Buttocks who was the Oracle of Delphi, and Nostradamus are among the many who foretold the return of the Accursed One, the Great Corruptor, the Shadow of Datorim. Their prophecies, and those of countless others, speak of a darkness that will engulf the world. Below are excerpt of their Prophecy in it’s original form and it’s translation with explanation:

[Discovery Detail] Discovered in the Ruins of Teotihuacan, 1893 - Final Translation Completed in 2025
[Translation by] Translated by Dr. Esteban Xolotl & Professor James Whitmore
[Scholarly Note] Fragment from Dr. Esteban Xolotl’s Field Notes (1893): “The glyphs on the temple walls spoke of a god of hunger, an endless devourer. The prophecy warns of his imprisonment, yet it also hints at his inevitable return. The scholars dismiss it as myth, but I fear that it is a truth we are not prepared to face.”

[English Translation of the Prophecy]
Direct English Translation:
A serpent of fire, a bird of jade, Born in the heart of the land, shadowed in death. The wind carries the whispers of blood and stone, The priest of darkness walks the path unseen.
The land trembles beneath the jaguar’s curse, The house of the deer burns in crimson light.
A blackened priest, a god of night, A river of shadows flows from the abyss.
His name shall be feared, sung in dark verses, His heart beats behind the veil of time.
The tail of the night coils upon itself, The night shall never end.

[Interpretation]
Scholarly Summary & Interpretation:
This prophecy, recorded in the lost codex of Diu' Ni-laomar, foretells the rise, fall, and ultimate return of Ste'vi 'Ra, the Accursed One. The 'serpent of fire' symbolizes his birth, a fusion of divine Annunaki and mortal lineage. His mother’s death and his subsequent thirst for vengeance are depicted in 'shadowed in death' and 'the wind carries whispers of blood and stone.'
The 'blackened priest' and 'god of night' signify Ste'vi 'Ra’s defilement of sacred temples, including the Temple of Sama-Ji, and his consumption of divine essence to augment his power. His inevitable defeat and sealing by Sama-Ji are implied by 'the priest of darkness walks the path unseen'—a reference to his continued influence despite being imprisoned.
The mention of the 'house of the deer burning in crimson light' is believed to symbolize Bakura's fall into darkness, as he unknowingly serves as a vessel for Ste'vi 'Ra’s resurgence. The 'river of shadows' speaks to the spread of his influence through war, conflict, and the slow poisoning of mortal minds. His resurgence at the end of time is cemented by 'the night shall never end,' suggesting that his return will mark the ultimate battle between light and darkness.
The final passage, 'the tail of the night coils upon itself,' is widely interpreted as a reference to the cyclical nature of his entrapment and reawakening, culminating in an apocalyptic confrontation with Sama-Ji. Scholars believe this prophecy aligns with the eschatological concept of cosmic warfare between divine beings, similar to the battles of Ragnarok or the final clash between Lucifer and the Divine.
It is said that the last verse remains unfinished, hinting at an unknown fate beyond the final battle. Whether Sama-Ji prevails or Ste'vi 'Ra engulfs existence in eternal night remains a mystery lost to time.

[Original Prophecy Text]
Original Ancient Greek:
Τέκνον ζοφώδες, αίματος γένεσις, σκιερὸς φέρων Μητρὸς θανούσης ὄμμασι δακρυομένοις, Ἀνουννάκι σπέρμα. Τὸν πατέρα τοῦ φόνου τὸν χυμὸν ἐκπιών, Βάπτισμα τοῦ σκότους, ἱερῶν αἱμάτων πόσις.
Ἐν τῷ ναῷ τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ πανσόφου ἐμόλυνεν, Τοῦ Σαμα-Γῆς τοῦ ἀειζώου σπέρμα κλέψας. ἀλλ’ ἔδησε αὐτὸν ὁ τρισμέγιστος, τὰς ἁλύσεις ῥίψας.
Καὶ ὅμως, ὁ χρόνος τὰ δεσμὰ ἀσθενεῖ, καὶ ἄνθρωπος τις, κλέπτης νυκτερινός, θυρὰς ἀρχαίας ἥψατο, καὶ τῷ σκότει ἐδέξατο.
Κατὰ τὴν δευτέραν ἥμεραν τοῦ ἄσβεστου πολέμου, ὁ ληστὴς καὶ τὸ σκότος ἕν γένοιντο. Πρὸς τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἡλίου ἐστάθη, καὶ ἡ μοῖρα ἐσφραγίσθη.
Δὶς ἐδέθη, ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἀπέθανε. Διὰ χιλιετίας κέκρυπται, ὁρῶν δ’ ὀνειράτων τοῦ κόσμου, Λίθοι αἱμάσσοντες ὑπὸ πόδας, ἄνθρωποι μαχόμενοι.
Ἐν τέλει, ὅτε οἱ χρόνοι ἀπολήξουσιν, αἱ ἀλυσίδες ῥαγήσονται, καὶ τὸ μέλαν ῥεύσει. Δήμιοι τερατόμορφοι ἐκ τοῦ κενοῦ γεννηθήσονται, καὶ ὁ κόσμος φρίξει τὸν μέγαν ἀγῶνα.
Ὁ θεὸς τοῦ παντός καὶ ὁ δαίμων τοῦ τίποτα, ξίφη διασταυροῦσιν ἐν τῷ τέλει τοῦ παντός.

[English Translation of the Prophecy]
Direct English Translation:
A child of darkness, born of blood, a shadow bearer, With weeping eyes he beheld his mother slain, seed of the Annunaki. He drank his father’s death, the crimson essence consumed, Baptized in shadow, drinking the sacred blood.
In the temple of the all-wise god, he defiled, Stealing the seed of Sama-Ji, the eternal one. Yet the great one bound him, casting chains upon him.
But time weakens all fetters, And a man, a thief of the night, Touched the ancient gate, and embraced the dark.
On the second day of the unending war, The thief and the darkness became one. He stood before the son of the sun, and fate was sealed.
Twice bound, but never dead, For a thousand years he slumbered, seeing the dreams of the world, Stones bleeding beneath his feet, men at war.
At last, when the years come to an end, The chains shall break, and the black tide shall flow. Monstrous executioners shall be born from the void, And the world shall tremble at the final battle.
The god of all and the demon of nothingness Shall cross swords at the end of time.

[Title] Excerpt from “Manuscrit d’Alexandrie, An 1457”, Prophecy of  Maître Nostradamus, “découvert dans les ruines de Datorim”
[Translation by] Translation by; Charles Delacroix, Université de Paris, 1796

[Original Prophecy Text]
En langue originale (Vieux Français)

[Verse 1]
Quand le sang du renégat lavera l’or de Kemet,
L’enfant maudit boira le feu des cieux.
Né d’un père divin et d’une mère mortelle,
Il pleurera l’ombre de celle qui l’a porté.

[Verse 2]
Son courroux forgera des rivières de sang,
Et dans la temple du Maître il souillera l’essence,
Celui qui mangea le fruit du Sacré,
Scellé sera sous le jugement de la Lumière.

[Verse 3]
Les âges passeront, et l’homme d’ombre viendra,
Un voleur des dunes portant le fardeau du péché.
Sa main versera le sang du dernier divin,
Ignorant qu’il abreuve un démon endormi.

[Verse 4]
Celui qui fût deux, celui qui portait un masque,
Affrontera l’élu du Maître, le roi du soleil.
La pierre les prendra tous deux,
Scellant l’ombre et la lumière dans l’éternelle prison.

[Verse 5]
Mais l’ombre persiste, rampant sous la terre,
Parlant aux fils de l’homme dans les songes interdits.
Lorsqu’un nouvel enfant touchera le fer ancien,
Les âmes brisées s’éveilleront à nouveau.

[Verse 6]
Le sang refluera vers la source,
L’ancienne plaie s’ouvrira de nouveau.
Dans le temps final, quand l’homme d’homme
Tirera l’épée contre son frère,
L’ombre éclatera les chaînes du destin.

[Verse 7]
Une armée de bêtes au râle funeste
Dévorera la lumière des mondes.
Les trois dimensions tomberont sous la gueule du renégat,
Et le Maître se lèvera pour l’ultime guerre.

[Verse 8]
Celui qui se déchira pour engendrer un fils,
Celui dont les dents mordent la lune,
Le monstre né du sang et de la souillure,
Portera la marque de l’Anti-Soleil.

[Verse 9]
Mais quand viendra le dernier jour,
Quand la nuit avalera l’aube,
Le combat du Maître et du Fléau sera chanté
Par ceux qui observeront la fin du temps

[English Translation of the Prophecy]
Direct English Translation:

[Verse 1]
When the blood of the renegade washes the gold of Kemet,
The accursed child shall drink the fire of the heavens.
Born of a divine father and a mortal mother,
He shall weep for the shadow of the one who bore him.

[Verse 2]
His wrath shall forge rivers of blood,
And in the temple of the Master, he shall defile the essence.
He who consumed the fruit of the Sacred
Shall be sealed under the judgment of the Light.

[Verse 3]
Ages shall pass, and the man of shadows shall come,
A thief of the dunes bearing the burden of sin.
His hand shall spill the blood of the last divine,
Unknowing that he nourishes a sleeping demon.

[Verse 4]
He who was two, he who wore a mask,
Shall face the chosen of the Master, the sun king.
The stone shall take them both,
Sealing shadow and light in an eternal prison.

[Verse 5]
Yet the shadow lingers, crawling beneath the earth,
Speaking to the sons of men in forbidden dreams.
When a new child touches the ancient iron,
The broken souls shall awaken again.

[Verse 6]
The blood shall flow back to the source,
The ancient wound shall open once more.
In the final time, when man of man
Draws the sword against his brother,
The shadow shall shatter the chains of fate.

[Verse 7]
An army of beasts with a mournful howl
Shall devour the light of the worlds.
The three dimensions shall fall under the maw of the renegade,
And the Master shall rise for the ultimate war.

[Verse 8]
He who tore himself apart to birth a son,
He whose teeth bite the moon,
The monster born of blood and defilement,
Shall bear the mark of the Anti-Sun.

[Verse 9]
But when the last day comes,
When the night swallows the dawn,
The battle of the Master and the Scourge shall be sung
By those who witness the end of time.

[Interpretation]
Scholarly Interpretation (Summary)
This prophecy, attributed to Nostradamus and discovered in 1457 within the ruins of Datorim, describes the life and eventual rise of Ste’vi ‘Ra, the accursed half-Annunaki who seeks revenge and godhood. It forewarns of his initial sealing by Sama-Ji and the later manipulation of Bakura, whose actions unknowingly aid Ste’vi’s return. The text suggests that Ste’vi ‘Ra's influence spans millennia, subtly poisoning the minds of men and inciting war to fuel his power.
As the prophecy unfolds, it foretells the eventual breaking of Ste’vi’s seal, his dominion over the three dimensions, and his final battle with Sama-Ji at the end of time. A significant portion of the text also alludes to the creation of an Anti-Christ-like being, Vee-Sus, formed from Ste’vi’s own suffering and corruption. This abominable entity, described as hideous with enormous teeth and an unnatural form, is implied to be his ultimate weapon.
The final stanzas emphasize the apocalyptic confrontation, mirroring eschatological battles found in Christian and mythological texts. Scholars have linked this work to various mythological cycles, suggesting it reflects deeper universal themes of chaos versus order, and light versus darkness.
